A facile single-step pyrolysis process was used to prepare S. fusiforme biochar (SFBCX), where x denotes pyrolysis temperatures (600 °C-900 °C). The surface characterization revealed that SFBC800 possesses intrinsic N and P heteroatoms. The optimum experimental condition for acetaminophen (AAP) degradation (>98.70%) was achieved in 60 min using 1.0 mM peroxymonosulfate (PMS), 100 mg L−1 SFBC800, and pH 5.8 (unadjusted). Moreover, the degradation rate constant (k) was evaluated by the pseudo-first-order kinetic model. The maximum degradation (>98.70%) of AAP was achieved within 60 min of oxidation. Subsequently, the k value was calculated to be 6.7 × 10−2 min−1. The scavenger tests showed that radical and nonradical processes are involved in the SFBC800/PMS system. Moreover, the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the SFBC800/PMS system was confirmed using electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy. Intriguingly, both radical (O2•−, •OH, and SO4•−) and nonradical (1O2) ROS were formed in the SFBC800/PMS system. In addition, electrochemical studies were conducted to verify the electron transfer process of the nonradical mechanism in the SFBC800/PMS system. The scavenger and electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy showed that singlet oxygen (1O2) is the predominant component in AAP degradation. Under optimal condition, the SFBC800/PMS system reached ∼81% mineralization of AAP within 5 min and continued to ∼85% achieved over 60 min of oxidation.

Abstract: Eutrophication of coastal ecosystems often stimulates massive and uncontrolled growth of green macroalgae, causing serious ecological problems. These green tides are frequently exposed to light intensities that can reduce their growth via the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). To understand the physiological and biochemical mechanisms leading to the formation and maintenance of green tides, the interaction between inorganic nitrogen (Ni) and light was studied. In a bi-factorial physiological experiment simulating eutrophication under different light levels, the bloom-forming green macroalga Ulva rigida was exposed to a combination of ecologically relevant nitrate concentrations (3.8–44.7 µM) and light intensities (50–1100 µmol photons m−2 s−1) over three days. Although artificial eutrophication (≥ 21.7 µM) stimulated nitrate reductase activity, which regulated both nitrate uptake and vacuolar storage by a feedback mechanism, nitrogen assimilation remained constant. Growth was solely controlled by the light intensity because U. rigida was Ni-replete under oligotrophic conditions (3.8 µM), which requires an effective photoprotective mechanism. Fast declining Fv/Fm and non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) under excess light indicate that the combined photoinhibitory and PSII-reaction centre quenching avoided ROS production effectively. Thus, these mechanisms seem to be key to maintaining high photosynthetic activities and growth rates without producing ROS. Nevertheless, these photoprotective mechanisms allowed U. rigida to thrive under the contrasting experimental conditions with high daily growth rates (12–20%). This study helps understand the physiological mechanisms facilitating the formation and persistence of ecologically problematic green tides in coastal areas. © The Author(s) 2024.\r",{"entities":[[160,171,"SEAWEED"],[849,860,"SEAWEED"],[1291,1300,"SEAWEED"],[1782,1791,"SEAWEED"]]}],["Undaria pinnatifida (UP) contains multiple bioactive substances, such as polyphenols, polysaccharides, and amino acids, which are associated with various biological properties.

UP was extracted under three different conditions: a low-temperature water extract at 50 °C (UPLW), a high-temperature water extract at 90 °C (UPHW), and a 70 % ethanol extract (UPE). Nontargeted chemical profiling using high-performance liquid chromatography-triple/time-of-flight mass spectrometry (HPLC−Triple TOF−MS/MS) was conducted on the three UP extracts. Subsequently, α-glucosidase inhibitory (AGI) activity, glucose uptake, and the mRNA expression of sodium/glucose cotransporter 1 (SGLT1) and glucose transporter 2 (GLUT2) were evaluated in Caco-2 cell monolayers. Furthermore, an oral carbohydrate tolerance test was performed on C57BL/6 mice. The mice were orally administered UP at 300 mg/kg body weight (B.W.), and the blood glucose level and area under the curve (AUC) were measured. Compared with glucose, UPLW, UPHW and UPE significantly inhibited both glucose uptake and the mRNA expression of SGLT1 and GLUT2 in Caco-2 cell monolayers. After glucose, maltose, and sucrose loading, the blood glucose levels and AUC of the UPLW group were significantly lower than those of the control group. These findings suggest that UPLW has antihyperglycemic effects by regulating glucose uptake through glucose transporters and can be expected to alleviate postprandial hyperglycemia. Therefore, UPLW may have potential as a functional food ingredient for alleviating postprandial hyperglycemia. © 2024 The Author(s)\r",{"entities":[[0,19,"SEAWEED"]]}],["To explore the potential application of edible seaweed in traditional fermented foods, Gracilaria was used as the research object, and the response surface methodology was used to optimize the koji-making process of soy sauce by adding Gracilaria.

Results: UVB was the main component of solar radiation impacting the typical intertidal green macroalgae U. prolifera. AOX was found to be important during the process of photosynthesis optimization of U. prolifera due to a synergistic effect with non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) under UVB radiation. AOX and glycolate oxidase (GO) worked together to achieve NADPH homeostasis to achieve photosynthesis optimization under changes in PAR + UVB. The synergism of AOX with superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) was important during the process of ROS homeostasis under PAR + UVB. Conclusions: AOX plays an important role in the process of photosynthesis optimization and ROS homeostasis in U. prolifera under UVB radiation.

Biochemical assay kits and ELISA kits were employed to analyze serum and liver biochemical parameters, as well as the activity of antioxidant enzymes and alcohol metabolism-related enzymes. The presence of oxidative stress-related proteins in the liver was detected using western blotting. Liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry were used to profile serum metabolites in mice. The findings demonstrated that EP-H (100 mg/Kg) reduced serum ALT and AST activity by 2.31-fold and 2.32-fold, respectively, when compared to the alcohol-induced liver injury group. H&E staining revealed a significant attenuation of microvesicular steatosis and ballooning pathology in the EP-H group compared to the model group. EP administration was found to enhance alcohol metabolism by regulating metabolite-related enzymes (ADH and ALDH) and decreasing CYP2E1 expression. EP also modulated the Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway to bolster hepatic antioxidant capacity. Furthermore, EP restored the levels of lipid metabolites (Glycine, Butanoyl-CoA, and Acetyl-CoA) to normalcy.

Adipogenesis transcription factors including peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)γ, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-alpha (C/EBPα), and sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1 (SREBP-1) were ameliorated through the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway by EEB treatment in differentiated 3T3-L1 cells. EEB attenuated mitotic clonal expansion by upregulating cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CDKIs) while downregulating cyclins and CDKs. In HFD-fed mice, EEB significantly decreased the total body weight, fat tissue weight, and fat in the tissue. The protein expression of PPARγ, C/EBPα, and SREBP-1 was increased in the subcutaneous fat and liver tissues, while EEB decreased the expression levels of these transcription factors. EEB also inhibited lipogenesis by downregulating acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) and fatty acid synthase (FAS) expression in the subcutaneous fat and liver tissues. Moreover, the phosphorylation of AMPK and ACC was downregulated in the HFD-induced mouse group, whereas the administration of EEB improved AMPK and ACC phosphorylation; thus, EEB treatment may be related to the AMPK pathway. Histological analysis showed that EEB reduced the adipocyte size and fat accumulation in subcutaneous fat and liver tissues, respectively. EEB promotes thermogenesis in brown adipose tissue and improves insulin and leptin levels and blood lipid profiles.

Recently, a severe disease outbreak caused extensive kelp mortality in Sanggou Bay, China, one of the world’s largest high-density kelp farming areas. Here, through in situ investigations and simulation experiments, we find indications that an anomalously dramatic increase in elevated coastal seawater light penetration may have contributed to dysbiosis in the kelp Saccharina japonica’s microbiome. This dysbiosis promoted the proliferation of opportunistic pathogenic Enterobacterales, mainly including the genera Colwellia and Pseudoalteromonas. Using transcriptomic analyses, we revealed that high-light conditions likely induced oxidative stress in kelp, potentially facilitating opportunistic bacterial Enterobacterales attack that activates a terrestrial plant-like pattern recognition receptor system in kelp. Furthermore, we uncover crucial genotypic determinants of Enterobacterales dominance and pathogenicity within kelp tissue, including pathogen-associated molecular patterns, potential membrane-damaging toxins, and alginate and mannitol lysis capability. Finally, through analysis of kelp-associated microbiome data sets under the influence of ocean warming and acidification, we conclude that such Enterobacterales favoring microbiome shifts are likely to become more prevalent in future environmental conditions.

Seaweeds are autotrophic plants that are edible in Asia, especially in Indonesia, Philippines, China, and Korea, and recently in Europe, the USA, and Australia. The high rate of lipids, proteins, and fiber-content of seaweeds is an advantageous one. Their bioactive molecules play a major role in the pharmaceutical, nutraceutical, and cosmetics industries. The daily usage of seaweed has been increasing day by day, but their wild harvest rate does not meet their requirements. Hence, on-shore seaweed cultivation was initiated several decades ago in some Asian countries, and subsequently such culture-methods have been followed in some other countries (to encourage seaweed cultivation and its associated products). On-shore cultivation would provide a large algal-quantity at a specific time interval, but when it comes to edible purposes, on-shore cultivation fails to provide contamination free, and nutritionally rich seaweeds. Therefore, the land-based tank cultivation-practise could provide an opportunity to cultivate seaweed (without contamination) and also to make it possible to enhance their nutritional compounds under laboratory conditions initially.

However, limited reports focused on the multiple impacts of biochar, including energy consumption (EC) and environmental risk (ER). Hence, to recommend biochar as a green material for sustainable development, the three critical units were explored and quantitatively assessed based on an adapted 3E model (EA-EC-ER). The tested biochar was produced by limited-oxygen pyrolysis at 400–700 °C by using three typical biomasses (Ulva prolifera, phoenix tree, and municipal sludge), and the optimal operational modulus of the 3E model was identified using six key indicators. The findings revealed a significant positive correlation between EC and biochar yield (p < 0.05). The biochar produced by phoenix tree consumed more energy due to having higher content of unstable carbon fractions. Further, high-temperature and low-temperature biochar demonstrated different chromium removal mechanisms. Notably, the biochar produced at low temperature (400 °C) achieved better EA due to having high removal capacity and stability. Regarding ER, pyrolysis temperature of 500 °C could effectively stabilize the ecological risk in all biochar and the biochar produced by Ulva prolifera depicted the greatest reduction (37-fold). However, the increase in pyrolysis temperature would lead to an increase in global warming potential by nearly 22 times. Finally, the 3E model disclosed that the biochar produced by Ulva prolifera at 500 °C with low EC, high EA, and low ER had the most positive recommendation index (+78%). Importantly, a rapid assessment methodology was established by extracting parameters from the correlation. Based on this methodology, about eight percent of biochar can be the highest recommended from more than 100 collected peer-related data. Overall, the obtained findings highlighted that the multiple impacts of biochar should be considered to efficiently advance global sustainable development goals. © 2024\r",{"entities":[[601,615,"SEAWEED"],[1333,1347,"SEAWEED"],[1573,1587,"SEAWEED"]]}],["Seaweed consumption has gained popularity due to its nutritional value and potential health benefits.

To address this gap in knowledge, we carried out a feeding intervention study of three common edible seaweeds (Nori, Kombu, and Wakame) in 11 volunteers, aiming to elucidate the extent of both beneficial and harmful trace element exposure through seaweed consumption in humans. Concentrations of total arsenic, cobalt, copper, cadmium, iodine, molybdenum, selenium, and zinc were measured in urine samples before and following seaweed consumption. Elements concentrations were also measured in the seaweeds provided for the study. Descriptive analysis for each element were conducted and we used quantile g-computation approach to assess the association between the 8-element mixture and seaweed consumption. Differences in urine element concentrations and seaweed consumption were analyzed using generalized estimating equations (GEE). Urinary concentrations of iodine and total arsenic increased after seaweed consumption. When we analyze the 8-element mixture, the largest weight was observed for iodine after Kombu consumption while for total arsenic was observed after Wakame consumption. Similar results were observed when we compared the mean differences between the elements before and after seaweed consumption through the GEE.

Moreover, it was a sulfated polysaccharide with a degree of substitution (DS) of 1.48.

Noticeably, the content of liver glycogen in the HEP group was significantly higher (62.62%) than that in the HFD group, indicating the promotion of glycogen synthesis. These beneficial effects were attributed to significantly increased protein kinase B (AKT) phosphorylation and its downstream signaling response. Further studies showed that diabetic mice exhibited excessive O-GlcNAcylation level and high expression of O-linked β-D-N-acetylglucosamine transferase (OGT), which were decreased by 62.21 and 30.43% in the HEP group.

One health issue regarding the consumption of seaweeds and specifically, kelp, is the accumulation of some trace elements of concern within tissues. As atmospheric CO2 concentrations rise, and global oceans acidify, the concentrations of elements in seawater and kelp may change. Here, we cultivated the sugar kelp, Saccharina latissima under ambient (~400 μatm) and elevated pCO2 (600–2400 μatm) conditions and examined the accumulation of trace elements using x-ray powder diffraction, sub-micron resolution x-ray imaging, and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Exposure of S. latissima to higher concentrations of pCO2 and lower pH caused a significant increase (p < 0.05) in the iodine and arsenic content of kelp along with increased subcellular heterogeneity of these two elements as well as bromine. The iodine-to‑calcium and bromine-to‑calcium ratios of kelp also increased significantly under high CO2/low pH (p < 0.05). In contrast, high CO2/low pH significantly reduced levels of copper and cadmium in kelp tissue (p < 0.05) and there were significant inverse correlations between concentrations of pCO2 and concentrations of cadmium and copper in kelp (p < 0.05). Changes in copper and cadmium levels in kelp were counter to expected changes in their free ionic concentrations in seawater, suggesting that the influence of low pH on algal physiology was an important control on the elemental content of kelp.

First, a pretrained image super-resolution model was integrated to improve the spatial resolution of the GF-1 WFV images and minimize the impact of mixed pixels caused by the strip distribution. Side-window convolution was also explored to enhance the edge features of HABs and minimize the effects of uneven biomass distribution. In addition, a convolutional encoder-decoder network was constructed for threshold-free HAB recognition to address the dependence on thresholds in existing methods. HAB-Net effectively recognized HABs from GF-1 WFV images, achieving an average precision of 90.1% and an F1-score of 0.86. HAB-Net showed more fine-grained recognition results than those of existing methods, with over 4% improvement in the F1-Score, especially in the marginal areas of HAB distribution.

A hydroponic solution of Ulva fasciata was found to contain trace levels (9–333 μg L−1) of 2,4,6-tribromophenol (TBP), a typical BP. TBP at a concentration of 165 μg L−1 significantly increased the inhibition zone diameter of widely used β-lactam antibiotics (amoxicillin and ampicillin) against V. alginolyticus M7 (Va. M7) and V. parahaemolyticus M3 (Vp. M3) as well as reduced the minimum inhibitory concentration by 2–4 fold against Va. M7. Whole genome re-sequencing analysis demonstrated that Va. M3 (53−60) had more mutant genes than Vp. M7 (44) in β-lactam resistance pathway. Transcriptome sequencing analysis, along with verification through RT-qPCR, further showed that oligopeptide permease (opp) was the only differentially expressed gene (DEG) among the mutated genes in the β-lactam resistance pathway. The opp transport activity and membrane permeability of Vibrio were both enhanced at 165 μg L−1 of TBP, and the ability of biofilm formation was also decreased.

In this study, we investigated the influence of mariculture on the rhizosphere and seawater microbiome surrounding Zostera marina and focused on the bacterial, eukaryotic, and fungal components in the composition, diversity, metabolism, and responses to mariculture-related environmental factors. Results: Significant differences in the composition, richness, diversity, and internal relations of the bacterial community between the seawater and rhizosphere sediment surrounding Z. marina were observed, while differences in the eukaryotic and fungal communities were less significant. More complex bacterial and fungal co-occurrence networks were found in the seawater and rhizosphere sediment of the Saccharina japonica (SJ) and sea cucumber (SC) culture zones. The seawater in the SJ zone had higher levels of dissimilatory and assimilatory nitrate reduction, denitrification, and nitrogen fixation processes than the other three zones. The assimilatory sulfate reduction enzymes were higher in the rhizosphere sediments of the SJ zone than in the other three zones. Tetracycline, sulfonamide, and diaminopyrimidine resistance genes were enriched in the mariculture SJ and SC zones.

Notably, more than 75% of the area of Ulva prolifera green tides exhibited northward drift, which was significantly influenced by northern currents and wind fields. The analysis of driving factors indicates that factors such as average sea surface temperature, eastward wind speed, northward wind speed, precipitation, PO43- and N/P/Si significantly influence the biological growth rate of Ulva prolifera. Furthermore, coastal land use change and surface runoff, particularly surface runoff in June, significantly impacted the growth rate of Ulva prolifera, with Pearson correlation coefficients of 0.74 and 0.67, respectively.

More precisely, we utilize a heuristic Grey Wolf Optimization algorithm to find the best power index, which enhances the adaptability. To prove usefulness and robustness of MFCSNGBM(1,1) model, yields of seven common shellfishes (oyster, clam, mussel, scallop, razor clam, bloody clam, and snail) and three main algae (kelp, pinnatifid undaria, and laver) are predicted and compared with six competing models.

Here, in situ studies of bacterial community in the non-diseased and diseased areas (Shawo and Dongchu islands) and seawater nutrient levels were carried out. 16S rRNA sequencing showed that the bacterial richness of the studied seaweeds increased in the diseased area. Only in S. japonica, Algitalea outcompeted abundant primary bacteria with probiotic relationships to the host of the non-diseased area, and dominated in the diseased area (17.6% of the total abundance). Nitrogen and phosphorus levels in seawater were 57.8% and 19.6% higher in the non-diseased area than those in the diseased area, respectively, and were strongly correlated with the phycosphere bacteria at the family level of S. japonica. There was no difference in potential pathogenicity between the two areas, while positive signal communications decreased, and nitrogen cycle, chemoheterotrophy, and cellulolysis increased in the diseased area compared to the non-diseased area. Overall, white rot disease caused a structural disturbance in phycosphere bacterial community of S. japonica that related to seawater nutrient levels. Enriched degraders and altered bacterial community functions may exacerbate the disease.

Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis indicated that CLEA contained diverse organic compounds, including hydrocarbons, amino acids, and carboxylic acids.

CLEA reduced lipid accumulation and intracellular triglyceride levels in HepG2 cells stimulated with oleic acid. The effect of CLEA on regulating expression of lipid metabolism-related molecules was investigated by qPCR and immunoblotting. CLEA promoted expression of the SIRT1 gene in oleic acid-treated HepG2 cells. CLEA also reduced expression levels of SREBF1, FAS, and ACC genes, which might be related to activation of AMPK signaling in lipid-accumulated HepG2 cells.

This study aimed to evaluate the effect of these enzymes on nutrient digestibility and gut health of weaned piglets fed with 10% L. digitata. Diets did not affect growth performance (P > 0.05). The majority of the feed fractions had similar digestibility across all diets, but the supplementation of alginate lyase increased hemicellulose digestibility by 3.3% compared to the control group (P = 0.047). Additionally, we observed that algal zinc was more readily available compared to the control group, even without enzymatic supplementation (P < 0.001). However, the increased digestibility of some minerals, such as potassium, raises concerns about potential mineral imbalance. Seaweed groups had a higher abundance of beneficial bacteria in colon contents, such as Prevotella, Oscillospira and Catenisphaera. Furthermore, the addition of alginate lyase led to a lower pH in the colon (P < 0.001) and caecum (P < 0.001) of piglets, which is possibly a result of released fermentable laminarin, and is consistent with the higher proportion of butyric acid found in these intestinal compartments.

It could reduce the dependency of the current cosmetic industry on both petrochemicals and terrestrial plant-derived bioactive compounds. Note how, in contrast to terrestrial agriculture, industrial cultivation of seaweeds does not require arable land, freshwater, fertilizers, and pesticides. The valorization mode could also facilitate the sequestration of more greenhouse gas CO2 as daily-used chemicals, since the aerial productivity of seaweeds is much higher than that of terrestrial plants.

Additionally, we validated the role of PYP in vivo using a crystallization model of hyperoxalate-induced rats. PYP effectively scavenged the overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in HK-2 cells, inhibited the adhesion of calcium oxalate (CaOx) crystals on the cell surface, unblocked the cell cycle, restored the depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane potential, and inhibited cell death. PYP upregulated the expression of antioxidant proteins, including Nrf2, HO-1, SOD, and CAT, while decreasing the expression of Keap-1, thereby activating the Keap1/Nrf2 signaling pathway. PYP inhibited CaOx deposition in renal tubules in the rat crystallization model, significantly reduced high oxalate-induced renal injury, decreased the levels of the cell surface adhesion proteins, improved renal function in rats, and ultimately inhibited the formation of kidney stones.

A systematic review and quality assessment were conducted from October 2020 to December 2022 according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) and Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) guidance. Studies were identified in Ovid MEDLINE, Web of Science, PubMed, and Scopus. Eleven articles were eligible for review containing 4421 adults (aged ≥ 18 years). Vegan groups had the lowest median urinary iodine concentration (mUIC) (12.2/l). N one of the dietary groups had mUIC within the optimal range for iodine status (100-200 g/l) (WHO). Vegan diets had the poorest iodine intake (17.3 g/d) and were strongly associated with lower iodine intake (P = < 0.001) compared with omnivorous diets. Lower intake in vegan diets was influenced by sex (P = 0.007), the presence of voluntary or absence of Universal Salt Iodisation (USI) programmes (P = 0.01 & P = < 0.001), and living in a country with adequate iodine nutrition (P = < 0.001). Vegetarians and particularly vegans living in countries with no current USI programme continue to have increased risk of low iodine status, iodine deficiency and inadequate iodine intake. Further research into the usefulness of mandatory fortification of vegan appropriate foods is required.

It was observed that after removing U. pinnatifida, the concentration of the DOC decreased significantly (p < 0.05) within 4 days. Over a period of 120 days of degradation, the concentration of remaining DOC (26%) remained stable. The succession of microbial community corresponded to the three stages of DOC concentration variation. Moreover, the structure of microbes community and its metabolic function exhibited evident patterns of succession. The concentration of DOC was correlated negatively with the abundances of Planctomycetaceae (p < 0.01), and was correlated positively with the abundances of Roseobacteraceae and Rhodobacteraceae (p < 0.01). In addition, the metabolic pathways related to “Glycolysis/Gluconeogenesis”, “Alanine, aspartate, and glutamate metabolism”, “Citrate cycle (TCA cycle)” and “Tryptophan metabolism” was significantly correlated with the variations in DOC concentration (p < 0.05). These findings indicate that the variation in the DOC concentration was closely linked to the succession of Planctomycetaceae, Roseobacteraceae, Rhodobacteraceae, and the degradation of DOC derived from U. pinnatifida appeared to be influenced by metabolic functions. © 2023\r",{"entities":[[247,267,"SEAWEED"],[304,318,"SEAWEED"],[1390,1404,"SEAWEED"]]}],["Seaweeds, notably cochayuyo (Durvillaea incurvata), are recognized for their rich macro- and micronutrient content, along with their inhibitory effects on the α-glucosidase enzyme. The present study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of this inhibition in actual starchy food products under in vitro gastrointestinal conditions. This study utilized freeze-dried cochayuyo, extracted using hot pressurized liquid extraction with 50% ethanol at 120 °C and 1500 psi. The inhibition mechanism of α-glucosidase was determined, and the polyphenol composition of the extract was analyzed using Ultra-High-Performance Liquid Chromatography. This study further evaluated the extract’s impact on starch digestibility, total phenolic content, and antioxidant capacity in pasta (noodles) as representative starchy food under gastrointestinal conditions. The results indicate that the α-glucosidase inhibition mechanism is of mixed type. Phenolic compounds, primarily tetraphloroethol, could contribute to this anti-enzymatic activity. The extract was observed to decrease starch digestibility, indicated by a lower rate constant (0.0158 vs. 0.0261 min−1) and digested starch at an infinite time (77.4 vs. 80.5 g/100 g). A significant increase (~1200 vs. ~390 µmol TROLOX/100 g) in antioxidant activity was also noted during digestion when the extract was used. Thus, this study suggests that the cochayuyo extract can reduce starch digestion and enhance antioxidant capacity under gastrointestinal conditions. © 2023 by the authors.\r",{"entities":[[29,49,"SEAWEED"]]}],["Neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease are major causes of death worldwide and are characterized by a progressive loss of specific neuronal cells.

The protein content in both seaweeds was approximately 16 %, being primarily located within the cell walls. Both species exhibited similar amino acid profiles, with aspartic and glutamic acid being most abundant. However, processing impacted their amino acid profiles, leading to a significant decrease in labile amino acids like lysine. Nevertheless, essential amino acids constituted 35–36 % of the total in the native seaweeds and their processed products. Although the protein digestibility in both seaweed species was relatively low (<60 %), processing, particularly extrusion, enhanced it by approximately 10 %. Interestingly, the effect of the different processing steps on the digestibility varied between the two species. This difference was mainly attributed to compositional and structural differences. G. corneum exhibited increased digestibility with each processing step, while G. longissima reached maximum digestibility after extrusion. Notably, changes in the amino acid profiles of the processed products affected adversely the protein nutritional quality, with lysine becoming the limiting amino acid.

The applied PEF parameters comprised 1000 V applied voltage, 50 µs pulse duration, 200 pulses delivered at 3 Hz frequency, and an inter-electrode gap ranging from 3.9 to 4.4 mm.

Both PEF and pH played pivotal roles in the fractionation of Gracilaria sp., enhancing protein release compared to water extraction, PEF pre-treatment, or pH shift alone. The combination of PEF and sequential pH washes (pH 1 to 12) resulted in a total solute release of 9.61 ± 0.04% and protein release of 28.02 ± 0.2% with essential amino acid (EAA) content of 63.6 ± 5.3%, and branched amino acids (BCAA) content of 3.47 ± 0.06%.

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of the Campylaephora hypnaeoides J. Agardh (C. hypnaeoides), an edible seaweed traditionally eaten in Japan, on high-fat (HF) diet-induced obesity and related metabolic diseases in mice. Methods: Male C57BL/6J mice were randomly divided into the following groups: normal diet group, HF diet group, HF diet supplemented with 2% C. hypnaeoides, and HF diet supplemented with 6% C. hypnaeoides. After 13 weeks of treatment, the weight of the white adipose tissue and liver, and the serum levels of glucose, insulin, adipokines, and lipids were measured. Hepatic levels of adipokines, oxidant markers, and antioxidant markers were also determined. Insulin resistance was assessed by a glucose tolerance test. Polysaccharides of C. hypnaeoides were purified and their molecular weight was determined by high-performance seize exclusion chromatography. The anti-inflammatory effects of purified polysaccharides were evaluated in RAW264.7 cells. Results: Treatment of HF diet-induced obese mice with C. hypnaeoides for 13 weeks suppressed the increase in body weight and white adipose tissue weight. It also ameliorated insulin resistance, hyperglycemia, hepatic steatosis, and hypercholesterolemia. The ingestion of an HF diet increased serum levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), while it decreased serum adiponectin levels. In the liver, an HF diet markedly increased the MDA, TNF-α, and interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels, while it decreased glutathione and superoxide dismutase. These metabolic changes induced by HF diet feeding were ameliorated by dietary C. hypnaeoides. Purified polysaccharides and ethanol extract from C. hypnaeoides inhibited the lipopolysaccharide-induced overproduction of nitric oxide and TNF-α in macrophage RAW264.7 cells. Conclusions: The present results indicated that C. hypnaeoides was able to alleviate HF diet-induced metabolic disorders, including obesity, hyperglycemia, hepatic steatosis, and hypercholesterolemia by attenuating inflammation and improving the antioxidant capacity in mice.

DPHC treatment exhibited anti-glycation ability through suppression of AGE formation and AGE-collagen cross-linking generation, and disruption of cross-links formed between AGE-collagen. In addition, DPHC pre-treatment significantly suppressed reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, intracellular methylglyoxal (MGO)/AGEs accumulation, and activation of apoptosis cascade by MGO. Moreover, DPHC suppressed AGE-receptor for AGE (RAGE) interaction by competing with MG-H1 for the binding site of RAGE. Furthermore, DPHC pre-treatment regulated apoptosis-related protein expression and increased Nrf2, Glo-1, HO-1, CAT, NQO1, and SOD1.

Extraction techniques, ranging from more traditional techniques such as maceration to novel technologies, are required to obtain these components. Pressurized liquid extraction (PLE) is a green technique that uses high temperatures and pressure applied in conjunction with a solvent to extract components from a solid matrix. To improve the efficiency of this technique, different parameters such as the solvent, temperature, pressure, extraction time and number of cycles should be carefully optimized. It is important to note that PLE conditions allow for the extraction of target analytes in a short-time period while using less solvent and maintaining a high yield. Moreover, the combination of PLE with other techniques has been already applied to extract compounds from different matrices, including seaweeds.

The drugs currently available for hypercholesterolemia control have several side effects, so it is necessary to develop new effective and safer therapies. Seaweeds serve as sources of several bioactive compounds with claimed beneficial effects. Eisenia bicyclis (Aramé) and Porphyra tenera (Nori) are edible seaweeds that were previously recognized as rich in bioactive compounds. In the present study, we aim to evaluate the anti-hypercholesterolemia effect of these two seaweed extracts and their health potential. Both extracts, but more efficiently Aramé extract, have liver 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGR) inhibitory activity as well as the capability to reduce approximately 30% of cholesterol permeation through human Caco-2 cells by simulating the intestinal lining, which is a target for hypercholesterolemia treatments. An untargeted metabolomic assay on human intestinal Caco-2 and liver Hep-G2 cell lines exposed to Aramé and Nori extracts revealed changes in the cells’ metabolism, indicating the extracts’ health beneficial effects. The metabolic pathways affected by exposure to both extracts were associated with lipid metabolism, such as phospholipids, and fatty acid metabolism, amino acid pathways, cofactors, vitamins, and cellular respiration metabolism. The effects were more profound in Aramé-treated cells, but they were also observed in Nori-exposed cells. The metabolite modifications were associated with the protection against CVDs and other diseases and to the improvement of the cells’ oxidative stress tolerance. The results obtained for the anti-hypercholesterolemia properties, in addition to the revelation of the positive impact on cell metabolism, offer an important contribution for further evaluation of these seaweed extracts as functional foods or for CVD prevention. © 2023 by the authors.\r",{"entities":[[443,459,"SEAWEED"],[472,487,"SEAWEED"]]}],["The present work reports on the development of a 3D origami microfluidic paper-based analytical device (3D µPAD) for the determination of iodide and iodate in edible seaweeds by smartphone-based colorimetric detection.

Recent molecular and cell biology studies have shown that n-3 unsaturated fatty acids exert pleiotropic effects on vascular endothelial cells, inflammatory cells, and platelets, suppress lesion formation and plaque instability, prevent recurrence of vascular events and cardiac death in patients with ischemic heart disease. Since around 2010′, attention has been focused on the n-3 fatty acids and DHA of edible “seaweed oil” extracted from algae. However, no previous studies have reported how dietary containing marine algae oil and nutritional oral taking habits affect post-operative adhesions. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of diets with different n-3/n-6 fatty acid content on adhesions in thoracic cavity. Methods: Four-week-old mice were randomly divided into three groups and housed in separate cages. The groups of animals were continuously provided with three different diets for 1 month (the Control group (n=4), DHA-containing “marine algae oil” diet; the DHA group (n=4), the HF group (n=5)). MI model mice were induced by a trained animal surgical expert. After operation, evaluated items were 1) body weight, 2) echocardiography for cardiac function, and 3) adhesions. Evaluations of 1) and 2) were performed before MI preparation, 1 day, and 7 days after MI, and assessment of 3) was evaluated the adhesion at 7 days after MI. Results: The results were 1) there were no significant differences in body weight among the three groups, 2) cardiac function in the HF group tended to deteriorate, and on post-operative day 7, the DHA group tended to deteriorate less than the Control group and 3) adhesions tended to be worse in the HF group and mild in the DHA group. Conclusion: Adhesions tended to be the worst in the HF group and mild in the DHA group.

To assign names to these morphologically similar species, the type and synonyms have to be examined, and if appropriate, new species must be described. The turf-forming red alga Polysiphonia scopulorum was originally described from Rottnest Island, Australia, and subsequently widely reported in tropical and temperate coasts based on morphological identifications. A recent study of molecular species delineation revealed a complex of 12 species in Australia, South Africa, and Europe. These species are placed in a taxonomically unresolved lineage of the tribe Polysiphonieae. The aim of this study was to resolve the genus- and species-level taxonomy of this complex and related species using molecular and morphological information. Three morphologically indistinguishable species of the complex were found at the type locality of P. scopulorum, preventing a straightforward assignment of the name to any of the molecular lineages. Therefore, we propose a molecularly characterized epitype. Polysiphonia caespitosa is reinstated for the only species found in its type locality in South Africa. We describe seven new species. Only one species of the complex can be morphologically recognized, with the other eight species indistinguishable based on morphometric analysis. The studied complex, together with another seven species currently placed in Polysiphonia and two Bryocladia species, formed a clade distinct from Polysiphonia sensu stricto. Based on observations of Bryocladia cervicornis (the generitype), we describe our seven new species in the genus Bryocladia and transfer another nine species from Polysiphonia to Bryocladia. © 2023 The Authors.

In the 1st set of experiment, rats were divided into five groups. Of which two were treatment groups beside three controls, the first treatment group was given ethanol extract of U. fasciata alone and the second group was given the same extract with AAP. In the 2nd set of experiment, rats were divided into nine groups, of which three treatment groups administered n-hexane, chloroform and methanol fractions of ethanol extract of U. fasciata respectively while other three treatment groups received the same fractions individually with AAP. On the 11th day, rats were decapitated after 12 h of fasting from both sets, blood samples were collected for assessment of biochemical parameters and kidney tissues were used for determination of oxidants and antioxidants. Histopathological assessment was also done in kidney tissues. A single dose of AAP (600 mg/kg) affected kidney markers including creatinine, urea and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and hepatic enzymes. Ethanolic extract of U. fasciata normalized kidney and liver markers in AAP intoxicated rats. AAP also reduced glutathione (GSH) in kidney tissues and altered kidney architecture, which were improved by ethanolic extract and chloroform soluble fraction of U. fasciata.

In the evaluation of 37 specimens, differences were found in the proximal composition, amino acid composition, and fatty acid profiles, which were specific to subgroups and supported their taxonomic classification, mainly at the order level. The red algae Porphyra/Pyropia (Bangiales) had the highest average percentage of protein (24.10%) and carbohydrates (59.85%) and the lowest percentage of ash (7.95%). Conversely, the brown alga Eisenia (Laminariales) had the lowest average percentage of protein, with different values related to the structure: 14.11% at the level of the frond and 9.46% at the level of the stipe. On the other hand, Bryopsidales green algae showed the highest average percentages of lipids (5.38%). The moisture percentages ranged from 4 to 16%, and no relevant significant differences were shown between the orders. The characteristic amino acids in all of the studied groups were glutamic acid, aspartic acid, alanine, and leucine. The highest average of the essential amino acids ratio was obtained for the Gigartinales red algae (48.65%), and the highest values of the essential amino acid index (EAAI) were obtained for the Ulvales, Laminariales, Gigartinales, and Rhodymeniales algae (EAAI > 0.92). The highest average relative percentage of fatty acids was obtained for polyunsaturated fatty acids, followed by saturated fatty acids.

After 24-h fermentation, L. plantarum exhibited a 21.32 % increase in the sonicated P. yezoensis sauce at 133.99 W/L and the logarithmic growth phase compared to that at 169.17 W/L.

Its physiology and ecology have been studied since the 1960s, given its ecological relevance on western temperate coasts. However, research interest has been rising recently, driven mainly by reports of negative impacts of anthropogenically induced environmental change and by the increased commercial interest in cultivating the species, with several industrial applications for the resulting biomass. Scope We used a variety of sources published between 2009 to May 2023 (but including some earlier literature where required), to provide a comprehensive review of the ecology, physiology, biochemical and molecular biology of S. latissima. In so doing we aimed to better understand the species’ response to stressors in natural communities, but also inform the sustainable cultivation of the species. Conclusion Due to its wide distribution, S. latissima has developed a variety of physiological and biochemical mechanisms to adjust to environmental changes, including adjustments in photosynthetic parameters, modulation of osmolytes and antioxidants, reprogramming of gene expression and epigenetic modifications, among others summarized in this review. This is particularly important because massive changes in the abundance and distribution of S. latissima have already been observed. Namely, presence and abundance of S. latissima has significantly decreased at the rear edges on both sides of the Atlantic, and increased in abundance at the polar regions. These changes were mainly caused by climate change and will therefore be increasingly evident in the future. Recent developments in genomics, transcriptomics and epigenomics have clarified the existence of genetic differentiation along its distributional range with implications in the fitness at some locations. The complex biotic and abiotic interactions unraveled here demonstrated the cascading effects the disappearance of a kelp forest can have in a marine ecosystem. We show how S. latissima is an excellent model to study acclimation and adaptation to environmental variability and how to predict future distribution and persistence under climate change. © The Author(s) 2023.\r",{"entities":[[26,46,"SEAWEED"],[748,761,"SEAWEED"],[964,976,"SEAWEED"],[1370,1382,"SEAWEED"],[1445,1457,"SEAWEED"],[2070,2082,"SEAWEED"]]}],["The American seaweed industry is growing, primarily into the edible sector, and more seaweed products are available for human consumption.

We evaluated the pathogen load of edible kelp post-harvest under three different storage temperatures (4˚C, 10˚C, 20˚C) and two different drying methods (air- and freeze-drying). The focal pathogens for this research included: Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella enterica, Staphylococcus aureus, pathogenic Escherichia coli, Vibrio vulnificus and Vibrio parahaemolyticus. We tested all six pathogens under each treatment condition on both sugar kelp (Saccharina latissima) and rockweed (Ascophyllum nodosum) as these are the most commonly farmed and wild-harvested species in Maine, respectively. We inoculated a known concentration of pathogen onto freshly harvested kelp, treated it under a storage temperature or drying method, and sampled it over time to determine the impact of treatment on pathogen load. Our results showed that storage at 20˚C can lead to replication while storage at 4˚C and 10˚C halted the replication of focal pathogens. Both air-drying and freeze-drying produced significant log scale reductions in surface pathogen load for all focal pathogens. Additionally, air-drying reduced pathogen load more than freeze-drying for a majority of pathogens and storing dried kelp for 6-weeks further reduced pathogen load across all cases.

Methods We conducted a survey of macrophyte abundance at 251 sites spanning the Atlantic coast of Nova Scotia from 2019 to 2022. We use this dataset to describe spatial variability in kelp species abundances, compare species occurrences to surveys conducted in 1982 and assess changes in kelp abundance over the past 22 years. We then relate spatial and temporal patterns in abundance and resilience to environmental metrics. Key Results Our results show losses of sea urchins and the cold-tolerant kelp species Alaria esculenta, Saccorhiza dermatodea and Agarum clathratum in Nova Scotia since 1982 in favour of the more warm-tolerant kelps Saccharina latissima and Laminaria digitata. Kelp abundances have increased slightly since 2000, and Saccharina latissima and L. digitata are widely abundant in the region today. The highest kelp cover occurs on wave-exposed shores and at sites where temperatures have remained below thresholds for growth (21 °C) and mortality (23 °C). Moreover, kelp has recovered from turf dominance following losses at some sites during a warm period from 2010 to 2012.

However, a broad-scale shift to turf-dominance has not occurred, as predicted, and our results suggest that resilience and persistence are still a feature of kelp forests in the region despite rapid warming over the past several decades. © The Author(s) 2023.

Therefore, in this cohort study, we aimed to investigate the association between dietary patterns and the risk of NAFLD among middle-aged Koreans. Design The survey was performed at general hospitals and health examination centres in Korea. Dietary intake was assessed using a validated Food Frequency Questionnaire. The dietary patterns were identified using principal component analysis. The HR and 95% CI for NAFLD for each of the quartiles of the three dietary patterns were estimated using a Cox proportional hazards model. Setting South Korean Community.

Results Men and women following a prudent pattern showed a 22% and 36% lower NAFLD risk, respectively (men: HR=0.78; women: HR=0.64). Men and women who highly adhered to the flour-based food and meat pattern had a 29% and 55% higher NAFLD risk, respectively (men: HR=1.29; women: HR=1.55). Conclusion The prudent pattern induced a lower NAFLD risk, whereas the flour-based food and meat pattern induced a higher NAFLD risk.

The seaweeds studied were brown (Padina australis, Sargassum binderi, Sargassum polycystum), green (Caulerpa racemosa, Caulerpa sertularioides), and red (Garcilaria changgi) seaweeds. The moisture, ash, protein, fat, and total dietary fibre contents of the seaweeds were analysed according to the Association of Official Analytical Chemists methods. Total available carbohydrate content was assessed using the Clegg-anthrone method. Mineral, amino acid, and fatty acid contents were determined through atomic absorption spectroscopy, high-performance liquid chromatography, and gas chromatography methods, respectively. Results revealed that the seaweeds were all high in total dietary fibre (53.96–76.97 g/100 g dried weight, dw) and ash (4.46–18.53 g/100 g dw) whereas their fat (0.05–4.62 g/100 g dw) content was generally low. The brown seaweeds were good sources of calcium. Red seaweed G. changii had the highest content of essential amino acids whereas brown seaweed S. binderi had the highest polyunsaturated fatty acid and lowest saturated fatty acid contents. Fucoxanthin could only be detected in brown seaweeds. Methanolic extracts of seaweeds showed good antioxidant activities measured using 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical scavenging activity (DPPH-RSA), ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP), and trolox equivalent antioxidant activity (TEAC) assays. Overall, this study contributed knowledge on underexploited Malaysian seaweeds and proposed them as an alternative source of nutrients for humans to meet food security challenges. © 2023\r",{"entities":[[325,334,"LOCATION"],[368,384,"SEAWEED"],[386,403,"SEAWEED"],[405,425,"SEAWEED"],[435,452,"SEAWEED"],[454,477,"SEAWEED"],[489,507,"SEAWEED"],[1227,1237,"SEAWEED"],[1309,1319,"SEAWEED"]]}],["Filamentous fungi belonging to the genus Aspergillus are prodigious producers of alkaloids, particularly prenylated indole alkaloids, that often exhibit structurally diversified skeletons and potent biological activities.

The chemical structures of the compounds were elucidated by comprehensive NMR and HRESIMS spectroscopic analyses. In addition to the previously reported prenylated indole alkaloids, aspertaichamide A (1) was characterized as having an unusual ring structure with the fusion of a 3-pyrrolidone dimethylbenzopyran to the bicyclo[2.2.2]diazaoctane moiety, which was rare in these kinds of compounds. The absolute configuration of 1 was determined by TDDFT-ECD calculations. In vitro cytotoxic assays revealed that the novel compound 1 possessed selective cytotoxic activity against five human tumor cell lines (A549, HeLa, HepG2, HCT-116, and AGS), with IC50 values of 1.7–48.5 μM. Most importantly, compound 1 decreased the viability of AGS cells in a concentration-dependent manner with an IC50 value of 1.7 μM.

Common sources of dietary polyphenols are vegetables, fruits, berries, cereals, whole grains, etc. Owing to their original form, they are difficult to get absorbed. Dietary polyphenols after undergoing gut microbial metabolism form bioaccessible and effective metabolites. Polyphenols and derived metabolites are all together a diversified group of compounds exhibiting pharmacological activities against cardiovascular, cancer, oxidative stress, inflammatory, and bacterial diseases. The formed metabolites are sometimes even more bioavailable and efficacious than the parent polyphenols. Studies on gut microbial metabolism of dietary polyphenols have introduced new approach for the use of polyphenol-rich food in the form of supplementary diet. This review provides insights on various aspects including classification of polyphenols, gut microbiota-mediated metabolism of polyphenols, chemistry of polyphenol metabolism, and pharmacological actions of gut microbial metabolites of polyphenols. It also suggests the use of polyphenols from marine source for the microbial metabolism studies. Till date, gut microbial metabolism of polyphenols from terrestrial sources is extensively studied as compared to marine polyphenols. Marine ecosystem is a profound but partially explored source of phytoconstituents. Among them, edible seaweeds contain high concentration of polyphenols, especially phlorotannins. Hence, microbial metabolism studies of seaweeds can unravel the pharmacological potential of marine polyphenol-derived metabolites. © 2023, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to University of Navarra.\r",{"entities":[]}],["The present study focuses on the production of Ulva fasciata biomass by optimizing the culture conditions like nitrogen concentration, media usage, stocking density, and cultivation trail in outdoor cultivation. Overall, six types of experimental media, viz., N:P, NL:P, NL2:P, 0N:P, 2N:P, and 3N:P, along with control (without media) were used, and sodium nitrate was used as a nitrogen source. The experiment was conducted by using 30 PSU salinity seawater in 500-mL round-bottom conical flasks, and the duration of the experiment was for 15 days. During the experiment, every 5-day interval, the algal sample was collected, and DGR and length were measured to assess the growth of algae. The highest average DGR (13.79% day−1) was found in the 3N:P combination (P < 0.001) with higher length (4.1 ± 0.3 cm) which was 4.85-folds higher than the initial length. For media usage and IPD optimization, the highest DGR was found in 100% of modified MP1 (2.87 ± 0.12% day−1) and 1.0 g/5L IPD (8.04 ± 0.07% day−1) than the other tested combinations. The outdoor tank cultivation (500 L) of U. fasciata exhibited higher growth rate (5.10 ± 0.19% day−1), and higher length (3.8 ± 0.2 cm) was found on the 10th day. In 3N:P-treated U. fasciata, lipid (2.86 ± 0.08% DW) and carbohydrate (12.35 ± 0.29% DW) levels were high, while protein (2.79 ± 0.09% DW) levels were high in MP1 media fed U. fasciata. These results have revealed that the modified nitrogen-treated U. fasciata seedlings can grow in outdoor tanks without media and can also accumulate higher carbohydrate and lipid (with a high growth rate) than the wild plant as well as the conventional media (MP1) grown plants.

As part of the ongoing search for antidiabetic chemicals, marine algae have been demonstrated to be an excellent source due to their medicinal properties. In this study, Ulva reticulata extracts were investigated for their anti-diabetic effect by examining its inhibitory effects on α-amylase, α-glucosidase, and DPP-IV and antioxidant (DPPH) potential in vitro and its purified fraction using animal models. Among the various solvents used, the Methanolic extract of Ulva reticulata (MEUR) displayed the highest antidiabetic activity in both in vitro and in vivo; it showed no cytotoxicity and hence was subjected to bioassay-guided chromatographic separation. Among the seven isolated fractions (F1 to F7), the F4 (chloroform) fraction exhibited substantial total phenolic content (65.19 μg mL−1) and total flavonoid content (20.33 μg mL−1), which showed the promising inhibition against α-amylase (71.67%) and α-glucosidase (38.01%). Active fraction (F4) was further purified using column chromatography, subjected to thin-layer chromatography (TLC), and characterized by spectroscopy techniques. Upon structural elucidation, five distinct compounds, namely, Nonane, Hexadecanoic acid, 1-dodecanol, Cyclodecane methyl, and phenol, phenol, 3,5-bis(1,1-dimethylethyl) were identified. The antidiabetic mechanism of active fraction (F4) was further investigated using various in vitro and in vivo models. The results displayed that in in vitro both 1 and 24 h in vitro cultures, the active fraction (F4) at a concentration of 100 μg mL−1 demonstrated maximum glucose-induced insulin secretion at 4 mM (0.357 and 0.582 μg mL−1) and 20 mM (0.848 and 1.032 μg mL−1). The active fraction (F4) reduces blood glucose levels in normoglycaemic animals and produces effects similar to that of standard acarbose. Active fraction (F4) also demonstrated outstanding hypoglycaemic activity in hyperglycemic animals at a dose of 10 mg/kg B.wt. In the STZ-induced diabetic rat model, the active fraction (F4) showed a (61%) reduction in blood glucose level when compared to the standard drug glibenclamide (68%).

The foundation species Gelidium corneum (Hudson) J.V. Lamouroux has shown a long-term decline in the Southeastern Bay of Biscay. We conducted an in situ experiment to investigate the combined effect of solar radiation and nutrient availability on the photosynthetic acclimation and growth of this macrophyte, and on the species richness and diversity of the assemblages that it forms. Photochemical stress in G. corneum was found to be greater at the end of the study, probably as a result of a prolonged exposure to high irradiance (PAR and UVR) and due to high temperatures during summer. We found an acclimation of G. corneum specimens to summer light and thermal conditions through dynamic/reversible photoinhibition and a decrease in photosynthetic efficiency. Nutrients may also have had a positive effect in dealing with the negative effects of these stressors. Under ongoing global climate change and projections for the future, further research will be needed to better understand the effects not only on canopy forming species but also on the whole community and thus on the functioning of the ecosystem. © 2023 The Authors\r",{"entities":[[108,124,"SEAWEED"],[494,504,"SEAWEED"],[703,713,"SEAWEED"]]}],["Background and Aims Kelps are the primary foundation species in temperate subtidal rocky shores worldwide. However, global change is causing their decline with consequences for the organisms that rely on them. An accurate assessment of these consequences may depend on which attributes of the associated community are considered. This study shows that conventional α-diversity approaches may overlook some of these consequences compared to spatially explicit approaches such as with β-diversity. Methods A 1-year seasonal study was conducted to compare the macroalgal understorey between healthy reefs with a Laminaria ochroleuca canopy and degraded reefs where the canopy collapsed years ago due to excessive fish herbivory. At each reef, the understorey seaweed assemblage was recorded in five replicate quadrats to estimate α-diversity (total richness, species density, Shannon index) and β-diversity (intra- and inter-reef scale). Key Results The understorey assemblage exhibited a distinct seasonal dynamic in both healthy and degraded reefs. α-Diversity attributes increased in spring and summer; turf-forming algae were particularly dominant in degraded reefs during summer. β-Diversity also showed seasonal variability, but mostly due to the changes in degraded reefs. None of the α-diversity estimates differed significantly between healthy and degraded reefs. In contrast, spatial β-diversity was significantly lower in degraded reefs. Conclusions Although the loss of the kelp canopy affected the composition of the macroalgal understorey, none of the conventional indicators of α-diversity detected significant differences between healthy and degraded reefs. In contrast, small-scale spatial β-diversity decreased significantly as a result of deforestation, suggesting that the loss of kelp canopy may not significantly affect the number of species but still have an effect on their spatial arrangement. Our results suggest that small-scale β-diversity may be a good proxy for a more comprehensive assessment of the consequences of kelp forest decline. © The Author(s) 2023.\r",{"entities":[[609,629,"SEAWEED"]]}],["This study evaluates the distribution of pesticide residues (PRs) and assesses the ecological and human health risks posed by them from seawater, sediment and edible seaweeds in the Gulf of Mannar.

Understanding MHW impacts on foundation species is particularly important, given their structural role in communities and ecosystems. Methods We simulated a series of realistic MHWs with different levels of intensity (Control: 14 °C, Moderate: 18 °C, Extreme: 22 °C) and duration (14 or 28 d) and examined responses of two habitat-forming kelp species in the southwest UK. Here, Laminaria digitata reaches its trailing edge and is undergoing a range contraction, whereas Laminaria ochroleuca reaches its leading edge and is undergoing a range expansion. Key Results For both species, sub-lethal stress responses induced by moderate-intensity MHWs were exacerbated by longer duration. Extreme-intensity MHWs caused dramatic declines in growth and photosynthetic performance, and elevated bleaching, which were again exacerbated by longer MHW duration. Stress responses were most pronounced in L. ochroleuca, where almost complete tissue necrosis was observed by the end of the long-duration MHW. This was unexpected given the greater thermal safety margins assumed with leading edge populations. It is likely that prolonged exposure to sub-lethal thermal stress exceeded a physiological tipping point for L. ochroleuca, presumably due to depletion of internal reserves. Conclusions Overall, our study showed that exposure to MHW profiles projected to occur in the region in the coming decades can have significant deleterious effects on foundation kelp species, regardless of their thermal affinities and location within respective latitudinal ranges, which would probably have consequences for entire communities and ecosystems. © The Author(s) 2023.

In adulteration case, the prediction of different levels of pork in chicken meat and vice versa yielded high accuracy scores i.e., over 90%, while, using the SVM algorithm, the presence of bovine offal in beef was successfully detected. Additionally, Random Forest algorithm was efficient (accuracy>93% ) in discriminating seabass and seabream fish fillets. Concerning microbiological quality, as indicated by the performance indices, the developed models exhibited satisfactory performance in predicting microbial load in different foods (RMSE<1.00, R-squared>0.80). Indicatively, MSI spectral data combined with PLS-R could satisfactorily predict TAC and Pseudomonas spp. counts on the surface of chicken fillets regardless of storage temperature and batch variation based on the performance metrics (R-squared: 0.89, RMSE: 0.88) while, this algorithm presented also satisfactory performance in estimation microbial populations in brown edible seaweed (R-squared: 0.80, RMSE: 0.90).

In this paper, carrageenan is employed for the first time as a resistive memory device structure for both the resistive layer and substrate. The carrageenan substrate (CS) has the advantages of excellent optical transparency, low cost, abundant sources, being skin friendly, and biodegradability. Owing to the excellent bending ability of the CS, the In/carrageenan/Ag/CS memory device (ICAC) can fit closely to human skin. The fabricating process for the ICAC device does not involve a vacuum system. The ICAC device shows promising resistive switching behavior with a high ON/OFF ratio of over 106 and a uniform distribution of switching parameters. Furthermore, when carrageenan is used for both the resistive layer and substrate, this produces strong interfacial adhesion. The good matching of metal-insulator-metal (MIM) structures with flexible substrates enhances the strength of the device structure and result in good bending performance. Supported by convincing physical and electrical evidence, the good uniformity and bending performance of the ICAC device may be related to the ability of the Ag ions (from the bottom electrode) to migrate by interacting with the functional groups of the carrageenan and create Ag filaments. Understanding the underlying switching mechanisms of carrageenan memory devices may enable a new design space for transient resistive-switching memory.

Volatile and non-volatile compounds were analyzed using gas chromatography–mass selective detection and high-performance liquid chromatography–quadrupole-time of flight–mass spectrometry, respectively. Baked laver stored in light conditions for 60 days produced the most volatile compounds, whereas dried laver stored in the dark produced the least volatile compounds. Total 11 classes of volatile compounds were detected, including alkanes, alkenes, and ketones, with aldehydes being most abundant in dried laver stored under light. Metabolite analysis of non-volatile compounds led to the selection of 12 compounds with a higher variable importance projection (VIP) value of >1.0: 6 fatty acids (VIP 1.2–2.0), 2 flavanols (VIP 1.3–1.8), hydroxybenzoic acid (VIP 1.5), hydroxycinnamic acid (VIP 2.3), a phenolic acid ester (VIP 1.9), and phloroglucinol (VIP 1.2). Generally, levels of these compounds decreased more following storage in the light than under dark, irrespective of laver preparation. The content of linolenic acid was particularly affected by storage conditions, with light conditions causing a fourfold reduction in linolenic acid level compared with dark conditions, which could result in an increased formation of aldehydes. Gallic acid and sinapinic acid were detected in dried but not baked laver, as they are destroyed by heat treatment. Therefore, laver should be baked and stored in dark conditions to prevent the development of rancidity. Practical Application: Laver is one of the representative seaweeds, and the popularity among consumers increases. Although commercially available laver is prepared in dried or baked condition, scientific studies on the changes of metabolites, including volatile and non-volatile compounds during storage, are scarce.

In our experiments under simulated practical conditions, we revealed that TCNFs and QCNFs achieved an average removal efficiency of 98.71% against nanoplastic particles. Moreover, TCNFs and QCNFs exhibited higher adsorption capacities compared to those of existing materials, potentially offering a cost-effective advantage.

For salivary lysozyme, there was a trend for a lower magnitude of increase post-exercise (p = 0.08) and limited return towards pre-exercise in response to fucoidan. For salivary IgA, a greater acute exercise response was noted for IgA in response to fucoidan (~2.7-fold higher; p = 0.02). Different dosage and supplementation protocols and inclusion of additional immune markers should be considered in subsequent assessments of any potential benefits of fucoidan supplementation in healthy active adults. © 2024 The Author(s).

C. lentillifera is also one of the most suitable seaweeds for human consumption. It is rich in nutrients and contains a variety of amino acids, vitamins, polysaccharides and fatty acids needed by the human body. Among them, polysaccharide is the most important active component in C. lentillifera. According to research, the crude polysaccharide content of C. lentillifera accounts for 34.00%-64.97% of its dry weight, which is higher than that of most edible algae, such as Scagassum, Hizikia fusifarme and Undaria pinnatifida. At present, the main extraction methods for polysaccharides of C. lentillifera are water extraction, alkali extraction and ultrasonic-assisted extraction, and the extraction rate is 3.22%-11.30%, but there are still a large amount of polysaccharides that remains un-extracted. In order to develop a mild, efficient and low-cost extraction process of polysaccharides from C. lentillifera, and to explore the antioxidant activity of the polysaccharide, we screened five existing extraction methods of polysaccharides from C. lentillifera. Through single factor experiment and response surface experiment, the ratio of material to solution, extraction temperature, extraction time, amount of papain and extraction times were optimized, and the optimum process parameters were obtained. Polysaccharide concentration was determined by anthrone sulfate method in the experiment. In addition, we investigated the scavenging activity of the polysaccharide on DPPH and ABTS free radicals. The results showed that adding papain is the most efficient method to extract polysaccharides from C. lentillifera. The order of the factors affecting the extraction rate of polysaccharide from C. lentillifera is as follows: ratio of material to solution > extraction temperature > extraction time, and the ratio of material to solution showed an extremely significant influence on the extraction rate of the polysaccharide (P<0.001). The best extraction parameters after optimization were as follows: ratio of material to solution is 1∶45, extraction temperature 60 ℃, extraction time 3 h, extraction count 2 times, the addition amount of papain 2.0%. Under this condition, the extraction rate of polysaccharides can reach 41.24%±0.09%. In addition, polysaccharides from C. lentillifera had good scavenging activities on DPPH and ABTS free radicals, and their IC50 values were 2.32 and 0.67 mg/mL, respectively. This study shows that the optimized papain enzymatic hydrolysis can improve the extraction rate of polysaccharides from C. lentillifera effectively, among which the ratio of material solution is the most important factor affecting this method. Besids, the polysaccharides of C. lentillifera have good antioxidant activity.

Methods: Moisture, ash, and total lipids were determined gravimetrically. Crude protein was analysed by Duma’s combustion procedures. The total carbohydrate content was assayed by the phenol/sulphuric acid method. The assessment of the fatty acids methyl esters (FAMEs) was determined through GC-MS. Characterization of elemental analysis was performed by ICP-AES. Different standard microbiological methods were applied for microorganisms. Statistics were performed using the non-parametric Mann–Whitney U test to assess significant differences between samples. Results: Lipid contents (n = 3) were very low (1.6–2.3%), particularly in Palmaria palmata, and Chondrus crispus (1.6–1.7%). The protein content (n = 4) varied from 14.4% in P. palmata to 23.7% in Porphyra sp. Carbohydrates (n = 3) were the major constituent of most seaweeds (31–34%), except in Porphyra sp., with higher content in proteins than carbohydrates. Regarding the fatty acid content (n = 4), in general, saturated fatty acids (SFAs) were the most abundant followed by polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs). Among macro and trace elements (n = 3), Chondrus crispus shows the highest average content in Zn (71.1 mg·kg−1 D.W.), Palmaria palmata the highest average content in K (124.8 g·kg−1 D.W.), Porphyra sp. the highest average content in P (2.1 g·kg−1 D.W.), and Ulva sp. the highest average content of Ca (5.5 g·kg−1 D.W.), Mg (55.8 g·kg−1 D.W.), and Fe (336.3 mg·kg−1 D.W.). In general, Na and K were the most abundant elements among analysed seaweed. Additionally, the microbiological results (n = 4) comply with the Portuguese guidelines (subgroup 2D) on the application of general principles of food hygiene in ready-to-eat foods.

Lifestyle- and age-related diseases, which have a high impact on population health, are closely connected to underlying chronic inflammation. Therefore, we have studied crude extracts of green (Ulva fenestrata) and brown (Saccharina latissima) macroalgae, as two of the most promising food macroalgae in the Nordic countries for their effect on inflammation in vitro. Human macrophage-like reporter THP-1 cells were treated with macroalgae extracts and stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to induce inflammatory signalling. Effects of the macroalgae extracts were assessed on transcription factor activity of NF-κB and IRF as well as secretion and/or expression of the cytokines TNF-α and IFN-β and chemokines IL-8 and CXCL10. The crude macroalgae extracts were further separated into polyphenol-enriched and polysaccharide-enriched fractions, which were also tested for their effect on transcription factor activity. Interestingly, we observed a selective activation of NF-κB, when cells were treated with macroalgae extracts. On the other hand, pretreatment with macroalgae extracts selectively repressed IRF activation when inflammatory signaling was subsequently induced by LPS. This effect was consistent for both tested species as well as for polyphenol- and polysaccharide-enriched fractions, of which the latter had more pronounced effects. Overall, this is the first indication of how macroalgae could modulate inflammatory signaling by selective activation and subsequent repression of different pathways. Further in vitro and in vivo studies of this mechanism would be needed to understand how macroalgae consumption could influence the prevention of noncommunicable, lifestyle- and age-related diseases that are highly related to unbalanced inflammatory processes.  © 2024 Jennifer Mildenberger and Céline Rebours.\r",{"entities":[[627,642,"SEAWEED"],[655,675,"SEAWEED"]]}],["The nutritional value, elemental and fatty acid composition as well as key biological activities were determined in a large brown seaweed species (Saccorhiza polyschides, abundant in European shores), taking into account the effects of wild vs farmed and land-based vs open sea Integrated Multi-Trophic Aquaculture (IMTA) system dichotomies.

A statistical optimization study was done using response surface methodology (RSM) and the central composite design (CCD) technique to generate response surfaces for the sample with the highest uptake capacity. The effects of agitation period, pH, PP size, dosage, initial Pb(II) concentrations, and temperature on % biosorption were studied. The maximum Pb(II) adsorption was obtained at agitation time 240 min, pH 4, initial Pb(II) concentration – 20 mg L−1, PP dosage 20 mg/L, and temperature 303 K. Batch scale testing was used to investigate the kinetic, equilibrium, and thermodynamic aspects of biosorption. The process of biosorption experimentation reveals that the pseudo-second-order rate kinetic and Langmuir isotherm models are in good accord.

In the present work, extraction methods for seaweed phytosterols were compared and optimized by one-factor-at-one-time method and response surface methodology. Moreover, the quantitation method of total sterols and major sterol components, including fucosterol, saringosterol, and ostreasterol, was established and validated using 1H NMR. Furthermore, the developed extraction and determination methods were applied to investigate three common edible seaweeds from Japan (Hijiki, Wakame, and Kombu). As a result, the finally optimized conditions were ultrasound-assisted extraction with CHCl3-MeOH 2:3 for 15 min followed by saponification with 1.65 mL of 1.85 M KOH for 14.5 h. Based on the developed methods, phytosterols in three seaweeds were compared, and Hijiki showed an abundant total sterol amount (2.601 ± 0.171 mg/g DW), significantly higher than Wakame (1.845 ± 0.137 mg/g DW) and Kombu (1.171 ± 0.243 mg/g DW).

One of the causes of the discoloration is thought to be nutrient depletion (oligotrophication) due to nutrient uptake by diatoms. The goal of our study was to elucidate the mechanisms underlying phytoplankton blooms and the effects of such blooms on comprehensive nutrient cycles in the benthic–pelagic ecosystem. We developed a new ecosystem model, EMAGIN-L.P., simultaneously representing phytoplankton life cycle and the benthic–pelagic ecosystem. The life cycles of four types of phytoplankton—dinoflagellates (DFL), small diatoms (SDA), Coscinodiscus wailesii (CDW), and Eucampia zodiacus (EZ)—were numerically modeled and incorporated into an existing ecosystem model, ECOHYM (Sohma et al., 2008a), representing the food web among the benthic and pelagic systems and carbon–nitrogen–oxygen-coupled cycles driven by biogeochemical and physical processes. The model was applied to the Harima-Nada Sea where the discoloration of nori frequently occurs. The model reproduced the differences in timing and scale of the four phytoplankton blooms, and each bloom could be explained by a combination of temperature suitability, light availability, nutrient limitation, and vertical mixing within the water column. Furthermore, through a sensitivity analysis, competition for nutrient uptake among different types of phytoplankton was observed in the model. That is, from June to October, when DFL and SDA blooms occur, the SDA nutrient uptake rate is high and SDA suppresses the DFL bloom, while from November to March, when CDW and EZ blooms occur, the nutrient uptake rate of EZ is high and the CDW bloom is slightly suppressed. The developed model representing the phytoplankton bloom mechanisms in the whole benthic–pelagic coupled ecosystem will be a useful tool for revealing the mechanisms underlying the nutrient cycle and the contribution of harmful diatom blooms to the discoloration of nori. The modeling approach presented in this paper (i.e., categorizing different types of major phytoplankton and incorporating their life cycle into the entire benthic–pelagic coupling ecosystem) can be an effective method to understand, predict, and manage the problems caused by harmful diatom blooms across different damage types, harmful diatom species, and ocean areas. © 2022 The Authors\r",{"entities":[[203,220,"SEAWEED"]]}],["Sea mustard (Undaria pinnatifida), an important edible seaweed belonging to the brown algal family of Alariaceae, contains copious physiologically active substances.

To enable this, we constructed a comprehensive genomics resource for the edible seaweeds. These data could be used for systematic metabolomics and a proteome search for anti-cancer compound and peptides. In brief, we integrated and annotated 12 publicly available edible seaweed genomes (8 species and 268,071 proteins). In addition, we integrate the new seaweed genomic resources with established cancer bioinformatics pipelines to help identify potential seaweed proteins that could help mitigate the development of cancer. We present 7892 protein domains that were predicted to be associated with cancer proteins based on a protein domain–domain interaction. The most enriched protein families were associated with protein phosphorylation and insulin signalling, both of which are recognised to be crucial molecular components for patient survival in various cancers. In addition, we found 6692 seaweed proteins that could interact with over 100 tumour suppressor proteins, of which 147 are predicted to be secreted proteins.

While morphological characteristics are clearly contrasting among the two groups, both COI and rbcL phylogenies revealed a well-supported clade with no genetic differentiation between the two morphologies. Therefore, the phylogenies indicate that C. chamissoi and C. glomeratus form a single taxonomic entity with high morphological variability, large geographic distribution and at least two morphological forms.

Cooking is an effective way to improve food safety, but it can alter both the contents of elements along with speciation and bioavailability. Three common cooking methods, the soaking, steaming and boiling, were evaluated for their effects on the protein structures, protein digestibility, iodine content and iodine bioavailability of S. fusiforme. Design/methodology/approach: Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy was used to study the structural changes of protein, and an in vitro digestion/Caco-2 cell culture system was used to evaluate the digestibility of protein, bioaccessibility and bioavailability of iodine. Findings: Boiling and steaming altered the protein secondary structure demonstrated by increased a-helix and random coil and decreased β-sheet, which improved the in vitro protein digestibility. Iodine content was reduced by cooking, with the highest loss observed after boiling, followed by soaking and steaming, while it was found that both bioaccessibility and cellular uptake of iodine were significantly elevated by boiling and steaming using an in vitro digestion/Caco-2 cell culture system. The presence of ascorbic acid, citric acid or tyrosine was beneficial for the iodine absorption, while oxalic acid and phytic acid hindered the iodine bioavailability. Originality/value: The present finding suggested that cooking was conducive to the digestion and absorption of iodine in S. fusiforme. In addition, different dietary factors could have a certain impact on the absorption of iodine.

The modified sausages had low moisture and fat content (p < 0.05) but high ash and dietary fiber content (p < 0.05) compared to the control sausage. The addition of seaweed powder changed the texture of the sausages, mainly its hardness and chewiness (p < 0.05), but no significant difference in cohesiveness and springiness was found (p < 0.05). The modified sausages were shown to have high water holding capacities and cooking yields. The different types of seaweed modified the colour of the chicken sausages differently. In general, the L* (brightness) and b* (yellowness) values was low for all sausage samples containing seaweed powder (p < 0.05), while the a* (redness) value increased with the addition of the KA and SP seaweed powder but decreased for the sausage sample with added CL seaweed powder (p < 0.05). Moreover, the modified sausages have higher total phenolic contents and high antioxidant capacities, which contributed to slowing the oxidation of lipid in sausages during storage (p < 0.05).

The polysaccharides of the genus Gigartina have already shown promising results against human diseases, such as cancer and parasitic diseases. However, other compounds from this genus are also being studied (i.e., phenols and pigments), due to their bioactive properties.

This study evaluated the chemical composition and the sensory potential of water extracts made with two Quebec coast edible seaweeds (Saccharina longicruris and Palmaria palmata) and measured the influence of extraction parameters (seaweed species, temperature, and cooking time) on these aspects, in order to assess the culinary interest of these local resources and promote them as a food in phycogastronomy. Chemical composition (minerals, proteins, lipids, and carbohydrates) was determined for the crude seaweeds and different water extracts. Extract viscosity, color, and composition in umami (free amino acids, nucleotides) and volatile compounds were also determined. The results show that water extraction preserves the nutrients from crude seaweed. The effect of temperature and cooking time is variable depending on the component and the seaweed. Saccharina longicruris water extracts are more colorful, richer in minerals, uridine monophosphate (UMP), and have salty, marine-sea, and green aromas. Palmaria palmata water extracts are more viscous, with a higher amount of carbohydrates, inosine monophosphate (IMP), sweet and herbaceous-fruity aromas, and good umami flavor potential.

Based upon physiological changes and transcriptomic dynamics after wound stress in N. yezoensis and its congener Neoporphyra haitanensis, another cultivar that does not differentiate spores after wounding, we propose a three-phase model of wound-induced spore development in N. yezoensis. In Phase I, propagation of ROS by RBOH and SOD elicites systematic transduction of the wound signal, while Ca2+ dependent signaling induces cell reprogramming. In Phase II, a TOR signaling pathway and regulation of cyclin and CDK genes result in cell divisions that spread inward from the wound edge. Once sporangia form, Phase III involves expression of proteins required for spore maturation and cell wall softening. Our analyses not only provide the first model for core molecular processes controlling cellular reprogramming in rhodophytes, but also have practical implications for achieving greater control over seeding in commercial nori farming.

Methods: A total of 3457 patients with T2DM were included. Dietary information was obtained using 24-h recall, and adherence to dietary guidelines was estimated using the Korean Diabetes Association-Korean Ministry of Health and Welfare index. Depression was evaluated using a questionnaire. Participants who had responded “yes” to any of the three questions related to diagnosis, current condition, and treatment were defined as depression. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to examine the association between adherence to dietary guidelines and depression. Results: T2DM patients with a lower score on adherence to dietary guidelines were more likely to report depression than those with a higher score (Odds ratios (OR): 0.51, 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 0.30–0.87). Patients with poor adherence to moderate calorie consumption (OR: 1.65, 95% CI: 1.07–2.52) and regular meal patterns (OR: 1.69, 95% CI: 1.15–2.50) were more likely to report depression.

A strategy of interest to reduce coastal eutrophication is the cultivation of seaweeds in proximity to WRRF discharge plumes to bioextract nutrients from coastal waters. We report economic and environmental trade-offs of this proposed strategy for a 1,170 m3·d−1 (0.31 mgd) WRRF in Boothbay Harbor, Maine, targeting a Water Environment Research Federation (WERF) level 2 effluent nitrogen goal of 3 mg-N·L−1. The scenarios investigated include WRRF upgrade and year-round nutrient bioextractive aquaculture (Saccharina latissima and Gracilaria tikvahiae cultivation) with end uses of bioenergy feedstock, fertilizer, or food. Based on biomass production characteristics and tissue nitrogen contents in Boothbay Harbor, an aquaculture site of 5.4 hectares would bioextract equivalent nitrogen mass as WRRF upgrade to meet level 2 nitrogen effluent goals. Using a techno-economic analysis, the cost of a WRRF upgrade was estimated to be $0.31 m−3 wastewater treated. The cost of bioextractive seaweed aquaculture depended on beneficial use of seaweed. If dried and sold as sea vegetables (for human consumption), a net revenue of $0.72 m−3 wastewater treated could be generated. If dried and sold as commercial fertilizer, the net cost of nutrient removal would be $0.26 m−3 wastewater treated, less than the WRRF upgrade. However, if anaerobically digested to produce biogas, the net cost of treatment was estimated to be $0.499 m−3 wastewater treated. WRRF upgrade and bioextractive aquaculture significantly reduced marine eutrophication. Bioextractive aquaculture with use as biofuel feedstock had the best performance on human carcinogenic toxicity, global warming, and fossil resource scarcity, marine ecotoxicity, and freshwater ecotoxicity. Use of seaweed product as sea vegetables was favorable considering human non-carcinogenic toxicity, marine eutrophication, freshwater eutrophication, and terrestrial ecotoxicity.

Sulfate groups have been shown to play important roles in the bioactivities of these polysaccharides. Recent in vitro and in vivo studies have suggested that the biological effects of dietary SPs are associated with the modulation of the gut microbiota. Dietary SPs could regulate the gut microbiota structure and, accordingly, affect the production of bioactive microbial metabolites. Because of their differential chemical structures, dietary SPs may specifically affect the growth of certain gut microbiota and associated metabolite production, which may contribute to variable health effects. This review summarizes the latest findings on the types and structural characteristics of SPs, the effects of different processing techniques on the structural characteristics and health effects of SPs, and the current understanding of the role of gut microbiota in the health effects of SPs. These findings might help in better understanding the mechanism of the health effects of SPs and provide a scientific basis for their application as functional food. © 2021 Institute of Food Technologists®\r",{"entities":[]}],["We evaluated the levels of heavy metals and arsenic (As) species in 11 different types of seaweed collected from major coastal cities in Korea.

Post-MD simulation analyses such as PCA, DCCM, and free energy landscape were also evaluated. The quantum mechanical and electronic properties of the potential bioactive compounds were assessed using the density functional theory (DFT) study. These findings support the use of marine resources like edible seaweed waste for cancer drug development by using its bioactive compounds. The obtained results encourage further in vitro and in vivo research. Our in silico findings show that the compound has a high binding affinity for the catalytic site of the HDAC 2 protein and has drug-likeness properties, and can be utilized in drug development against cancer.

The present work aimed to assess the ameliorative and therapeutic roles of the aqueous and ethanolic extracts of the edible seaweed Sargassum virgatum (S. virgatum) on spermatogenesis and infertility in γ-irradiated Wistar rats. Materials and methods: Induction of infertility was performed by exposing the rats to 137Cs-gamma rays, using a single dose of 3.5 Gy. γ-irradiated rats were given the S. virgatum ethanolic (S. virgatum-EtOH) and aqueous extracts intraperitoneally on a daily base for two consecutive weeks at doses of 100 and 400 mg/kg body weight (b.wt.) for each seaweed extract. Morphometric data of the testes, semen quality indices, antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione (GSH), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) fragmentation were assessed. The results obtained were taken during two-time intervals of 15 and 60 days from the commencement of the algal treatments. In vitro antioxidant assays and polyphenolic compounds of S. virgatum were characterized. Results: Significant negative changes in the semen quality and morphometric data of the testes, as well as remarkable DNA fragmentation, were detected in the irradiated rats compared to the control. The levels of the endogenous antioxidant enzymes (SOD, CAT, GSH, and GPx) were also significantly diminished. Nonetheless, treatments of γ-irradiated rats with the S. virgatum-EtOH and aqueous extracts significantly improved the above-mentioned enzymes, in addition to noteworthy amendments in the dimensions of the testes, the semen quality, as well as the DNA structure. Conclusions: The ameliorative potency of S. virgatum to cure γ-irradiation-induced male infertility, particularly 400 mg/kg ethanolic extract for 60 days, is the result of the consistent therapeutic interventions of its potent antioxidant and anti-apoptotic polyphenols, particularly protocatechuic, p-hydroxybenzoic, rosmarinic, chlorogenic, cinnamic and gentisic acids, as well as the flavonoids catechin, hesperidin, rutin and quercetin. Besides its high-value nutraceutical importance, S. virgatum could be a natural candidate for developing well-accepted radioprotectant products capable of treating γ-irradiation-induced male infertility. © Copyright © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group LLC.\r",{"entities":[[294,312,"SEAWEED"],[314,325,"SEAWEED"],[559,570,"SEAWEED"],[1172,1183,"SEAWEED"],[1817,1828,"SEAWEED"],[2266,2277,"SEAWEED"]]}],["Seaweeds are being used as food items in Asian countries from ancient times.

The present study aimed to investigate the anti-adipogenic activities of isolated compounds from WBG on 8-day differentiated cultures of 3 T3-L1 adipocytes that were then stained with Oil Red O (ORO) or diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). RESULTS: ORO stains of the methanol extracts of de-seeded HM86 cultivar of WBG (WBG-M) and the ethyl acetate fractions (WBG-M-EA) showed anti-adipogenic activities against differentiated adipocytes. Two chlorophyll-degraded compounds, pheophorbide a (1) and pyropheophorbide a (2), were isolated from WBG-M-EA. Treatments with 1 (5, 10, and 20 μmol L−1) and 2 (2.5, 5, and 10 μmol L−1) showed dose-dependent reductions in lipid accumulations and reduced nuclear DAPI stains in differentiated 3 T3-L1 adipocytes. The concentrations for 50% inhibition against lipid accumulations of 1 and 2, respectively, were 16.05 and 7.04 μmol L−1. Treatments with 1 and 2 showed enhanced lactate dehydrogenase release in the first 4-day cell mitotic clonal expansions during the differentiating cultural processes, although the effect was less on the non-differentiating cultural processes. Thus, 1 and 2 were more toxic to differentiating adipocytes than to non-differentiated pre-adipocytes, which partly resulted in anti-adipogenic activities with lowered lipid accumulations. CONCLUSION: Both 1 and 2 showed anti-adipogenic activities in cell models.

The remarkable neurotrophic activity of Gelidium amansii, which has been reported consistently in a series of our previous studies, inspired us to investigate whether this popular agarophyte could protect against hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R)-induced oxidative injury in hippocampal neurons. The primary culture of hippocampal neurons challenged with H/R suffered from a significant loss of cell survival, accompanied by apoptosis and necrosis, DNA damage, generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and dissipation of mitochondrial membrane potential (∆Ψm), which were successfully attenuated when the neuronal cultures were preconditioned with ethanolic extract of G. amansii (GAE). GAE also attenuated an H/R-mediated increase of BAX and caspase 3 expressions while promoting Bcl-2 expression. Moreover, the expression of N-methyl-d-acetate receptor subunit 2B (GluN2B), an extrasynaptic glutamate receptor, was significantly repressed, while synaptic GluN2A expression was preserved in GAE-treated neurons as compared to those without GAE intervention. Together, this study demonstrates that GAE attenuated H/R-induced oxidative injury in hippocampal neurons through, at least in part, a potential neuroprotective mechanism that involves inhibition of GluN2B-mediated excitotoxicity and suppression of ROS production, and suggests that this edible seaweed could be a potential source of bioactive metabolites with therapeutic significance against oxidative stress-related neurodegeneration, including ischemic stroke and neurodegenerative diseases. © 2020 by the authors.

In this study, a production-environmental suitability model to estimate the impacts of environmental factors on seaweed production was developed. The developed model not only estimates human-induced disturbances but also quantifies the impacts of environmental factors responsible for the decline of annual seaweed production. The model estimated the temporal variation in human-induced disturbances and the effects of environmental factors (i.e., rainfall, CO                             2                              concentrations, temperature, typhoons, solar radiation, water nutrient levels, and water quality) on edible seaweeds in Japan from 1985 to 2012. Results: The environmental suitability for seaweed production in Japan was about 4.6 times greater in 1992 than in 2011, meanwhile as a result of human activities, human-induced disturbances of seaweed increased at a rate of 4.9 times faster during the period of 1998–2012 than the period of 1985–1997. The ratio of decreased production to decreased environmental suitability for seaweed production in Japan increased by 15.2% during the study years, which means that seaweed production has become more sensitive to environmental disturbances, including climatic factors and human activities in 1998–2012. Conclusions: The results are novel in demonstrating temporal variations in the level of environmental suitability to seaweed production by using a simple mathematical model.

Previous studies had demonstrated that the addition of seaweeds in the form of powder or extract can improve the properties of food products. Usually, conventional methods of extraction are used to extract bioactive compounds in seaweed such as hot water and solvent extraction. Hot water extraction may result in nutrient degradation due to the high temperature used while the use of solvent may raise the toxicity and environmental issues. Therefore, microbial fermentation seems to be one of the interesting alternatives to conventional methods of extraction since it can improve the biological functionalities and enhance the bioavailability of nutrients in seaweed. In this study, solid state fermentation (SSF) was conducted on three different varieties (green flower-GF, white giant-G and purple giant-PG) of Kappaphycus spp. by using Aspergillus oryzae at 30 °C for 4 days with 70% initial moisture content and 10% inoculum level. The effects of SSF on the physicochemical properties of seaweeds were investigated in terms of phenolic profile, amino acid composition and volatile compounds. The concentration of one of the main phenolic compound that contributes to its antioxidant activity in seaweed, caffeic acid was significantly enhanced after SSF. A similar trend was also noticed for total amino acids. Major hydrocarbon volatile compounds; hexadecane, pentadecane and heptadecane were also increased in concentration. An increased in bioavailability of phenolic compounds, amino acids and volatiles after SSF will be beneficial to be added as a food ingredient to improve the nutritional, taste and textural properties of food products. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

In this research, cooked Nori, Sea Lettuce and Kombu were subjected to an in vitro digestion and following micellarization investigations. The processing of red seaweed does not affect the chlorophyll recovery, while cooking green and brown seaweeds implies an important increase in chlorophyll recovery after in vitro digestion. In this line, while cooking affects negatively the micellarization rate of chlorophyll derivatives in Nori and Kombu, it does not modify the micellarization in Sea Lettuce. Generally, the chlorophyll bioaccessibility of microwaved seaweeds is always higher than that of boiled ones.

This study was designed to evaluate the antiviral activity of the sulphated polysaccharides “Carrageenan,” a linear sulphated polysaccharide that is extracted from red edible seaweeds against JEV replication in vitro. Viral inactivation, attachment, and post-infection assays were used to determine the mode of inhibition of Carrageenan. Virus titters after each application were evaluated by plaque formation assay. MTT assay was used to determine the 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC50), and ELISA-like cell-based assay and immunostaining and immunostaining techniques were used to evaluate the 50% effective concentration (EC50). This study showed that Carrageenan inhibited JEV at an EC50 of 15 µg/mL in a dose-dependent manner with CC50 more than 200 µg/mL in healthy human liver cells (WRL68). The mode of inhibition assay showed that the antiviral effects of Carrageenan are mainly due to their ability to inhibit the early stages of virus infection such as the viral attachment and the cellular entry stages.

While legislation and guidelines exist regulating the sustainable collection of wild edibles, the founding principles of the British foraging movement are not well documented. For this research, 36 of the most active foraging instructors of the Association of Foragers were interviewed to understand their background, species collected, sources of knowledge, and problems faced during collection. Altogether, 102 species of leafy vegetables, fruits, fungi, and seaweeds were mentioned as frequently used, while 34 species of roadkill animals were listed, mostly for personal consumption. Instructors reported learning from wild food guidebooks, other foragers, or personal experience. Frequent contact among foragers has led to the standardisation of knowledge and practices among them forming a “new tradition”, partly based on old British traditions but modified by influences from other countries and cultures, both in terms of choice of species and processing techniques. Contrary to expectations, foragers rarely reported clashes with nature conservation or forestry managers. The authors argue that knowledge and practice developed by the Association of Foragers (AoF) are sustainable and could be integrated into the British food and nature conservation system. © 2021 by the authors.

In this study, the effects of ascophyllan HS were evaluated in a severe intranasal Streptococcus pneumoniae infection mouse model. The control untreated mice started to die on day 7 and 80% had died by day 14 post-infection. Continuous oral administration of ascophyllan HS before and after bacterial infection resulted in a remarkable increase in survival rate, with 90% of the low (167 mg/kg body weight/day) and 100% of the high (500 mg/kg body weight/day) dose ascophyllan HS-treated mice surviving at day 14 post-infection. Histopathological observation of the lungs of the infected mice revealed the induction of typical pneumonia features in the alveolar spaces of the untreated control mice, such as extensive infiltration of inflammatory cells, edema, and fibrin deposition. In contrast, notable levels of lung injuries or alterations were not observed in the ascophyllan HS-treated mice, and only a minor lesion was observed in one mouse. Furthermore, bacterial burdens in the lungs were significantly reduced in the ascophyllan HS-treated mice as compared to the control mice at day 4 post-infection. Significantly higher levels of IL-12 were detected in the serum of ascophyllan HS-treated mice than that of control mice measured at the end of the infection experiment (day 14). These results suggest that orally administered ascophyllan HS exerts a therapeutic effect on S. pneumoniae infection by activating the host defense systems. This is the first report of the therapeutic effect of an orally administered seaweed polysaccharide preparation on S. pneumoniae infection.

In this study, we attempted to establish mutagenesis in U. pinnatifida using Ar and C ion beams as mutagens to meet future demands. To screen irradiated generations for mutants, U. pinnatifida zoospores irradiated with Ar and C ion beams were cultivated in plastic Petri dishes. Some gametophytes derived from the irradiated zoospores showed growth arrest or cell death at the initial developmental stage. Although the growth inhibition and lethal effects were observed at high doses of each ion irradiation, the Ar ion irradiation had high biological effects on cell division and growth. The gametophytes that showed a reduction in cell elongation were designated as an inhibited cell elongation mutant. A comparison of the mutant induction frequencies revealed that the C ion beam showed a higher frequency than the Ar ion beam. The highest frequency was 0.83% at 12.5 Gy of the C ion beam. We determined the total number of sporophytes and embryos per female gametophyte after sporophyte induction. High-dose irradiation with the Ar ion beam decreased the embryo and sporophyte formation, suggesting that the Ar ion beam also has exhibited high biological effects on the fertilization or embryogenesis processes or both.

The umami taste can be elicited by the synergistic effect of 5′-nucleotides, guanosine-5′-monophosphate (GMP), and inosine-5′-monophosphate (IMP). In this work, twelve edible seaweeds, two green (Codium tomentosum, Ulva rigida), six red (Chondracanthus teedei var. lusitanicus, Chondrus crispus, Gracilaria gracilis, Grateloupia turuturu, Nemalion helminthoides, Osmundea pinnatifida), and four brown (Bifurcaria bifurcata, Fucus vesiculosus, Saccorhiza polyschides, Undaria pinnatifida), from the Portuguese seashore, were selected for the analysis of umami amino acids and 5′-nucleotides. To determine the concentrations of umami free compounds, L-Glu, L-Asp, GMP, and IMP, the usual procedure for the preparation of seaweed’s broth was carried out, and the resulting extracts were analyzed by HPLC-DAD. The effect of the seaweed’s pretreatment, oven-dried and lyophilized, was also studied. Results showed that all seaweed species contained free amino acids in broad range, whereas umami 5′-nucleotides were not detected. The lyophilized C.crispus and G. gracilis contained the highest amounts of free L-Glu (627 ± 109 mg (100 g)−1 and 398 ± 67 mg (100 g)−1, respectively) and L-Asp (520 ± 102 mg (100 g)−1 and 270 ± 10 mg (100 g)−1, respectively).

High Cd stress significantly inhibited the seedlings growth, and darkened the thalli color. Additionally, the pigment contents, growth rate, peroxidase (POD) activity, dehydroascorbic acid (DHA) content, and glutathione reductase (GR) activity in S. fusiforme were significantly reduced by high Cd treatment.

The decrease of malondialdehyde (MDA) was not significant. Although S. fusiforme seedlings increased the antioxidant activities of POD, SOD, Vc, and the AsA-GSH cycle to disseminate H2O2 and maintain healthy metabolism, high Cd stress caused Cd accumulation in the stem and leaves of S. fusiforme seedlings.

Methods: Subjects were children aged 4 to 5 years attending a preschool in Aichi Prefecture, Japan, in 2010. Among 99 students, 89 (89.9%) were enrolled in our study. Nori (dried laver), an edible seaweed widely consumed in Japan, was used as a dietary intervention. Children in the intervention group were asked to consume 1.76 grams per day of roasted nori in addition to standard meals for 10 weeks. Children in the control group consumed their usual diet. Before the intervention and at the 10th week of the intervention, children’s blood pressure was measured three times successively using an automated sphygmomanometer with subjects in a sitting position. Changes in systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were compared between 55 children in the intervention group and 26 in the control group after adjustment for SBP and DBP before the intervention. Results: Changes in SBP were -8.29mmHg in the intervention group and +0.50mmHg in the control group (P for difference in change = 0.051). Changes in DBP were -6.77mmHg in the intervention group and -0.05mmHg in the control group (P = 0.031).

In each occasion, individual sporophytic and male and female gametophytic clumps were collected, and the longest blade with intact apex from each clump was evaluated. Blade length, width, density of spines, axis curvature and thickness, and pinnule length and width were evaluated in each blade. Principal components analyses separated two groups of thalli, one group with narrow, thick, and curved (concavo-convex) blades, with few spines consistent with f. lessonii, and another with broad, thin, and flat blades, with many spines consistent with f. chauvinii. These variables also had bimodal frequency distributions. Pinnule measurements were mainly associated with differences among sporophytes and gametophytes.

We determined the relative Mg bioavailability of TSK compared to MgO and examined factors affecting Mg bioavailability in TSK. RESULTS: The relative bioavailability of Mg in TSK compared with MgO was calculated as 92.3%, 111.4%, and 87.2% from apparent absorption, urinary excretion, and femoral concentration of Mg, respectively. The ultrafiltrable Mg concentration was lower in the cecal content of rats given TSK than those given MgO. However, the mRNA expression of TRPM6, an Mg channel responsible for Mg absorption, was higher in the cecum of rats given TSK than those given MgO.

Whole microbiota of zebrafish larvae and intestinal microbiota of adult zebrafish treated with OM fucoidan were analyzed by Illumina MiSeq pair-end sequencing of the V3–V4 region of 16S rRNA genes. Fucoidan treatment only slightly affected the composition of the larvae microbiota and the number of neutrophils and macrophages, while pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine gene expression levels were upregulated in the larvae treated with 500 μg/mL OM fucoidan. In contrast, feeding of OM fucoidan clearly altered the intestinal microbiota composition of adult zebrafish, which was characterized by the emergence and predominance of multiple bacterial operational taxonomic units (OTUs) affiliated with Rhizobiaceae and Comamonadaceae at the expense of E. coli-related Enterobacteriaceae, the dominant OTUs throughout the studied samples. These changes were accompanied by decreased expression levels of pro-inflammatory cytokine il1b in the intestines of the adult zebrafish.

Four strains, denominated S, K, O, and C, with distinctively different morphologies, have been cultivated commercially since the early 2000s. We previously reported a draft genome of the S-strain. To facilitate studies of seaweed biology for future aquaculture, we here decoded and analyzed genomes of the other three strains (K, O, and C). RESULTS: Here we improved the genome of the S-strain (ver. 2, 130 Mbp, 12,999 genes), and decoded the K-strain (135 Mbp, 12,511 genes), the O-strain (140 Mbp, 12,548 genes), and the C-strain (143 Mbp, 12,182 genes). Molecular phylogenies, using mitochondrial and nuclear genes, showed that the S-strain diverged first, followed by the K-strain, and most recently the C- and O-strains. Comparisons of genome architecture among the four strains document the frequent occurrence of inversions. In addition to gene acquisitions and losses, the S-, K-, O-, and C-strains possess 457, 344, 367, and 262 gene families unique to each strain, respectively. Comprehensive Blast searches showed that most genes have no sequence similarity to any entries in the non-redundant protein sequence database, although GO annotation suggested that they likely function in relation to molecular and biological processes and cellular components. CONCLUSIONS: Our study compares the genomes of four strains of C. okamuranus and examines their phylogenetic relationships. Due to global environmental changes, including temperature increases, acidification, and pollution, brown algal aquaculture is facing critical challenges. Genomic and phylogenetic information reported by the present research provides useful tools for isolation of novel strains.\r",{"entities":[[28,50,"SEAWEED"],[160,167,"LOCATION"],[169,175,"LOCATION"],[1505,1518,"SEAWEED"]]}],["Introduction. New natural antioxidants remain a relevant research task of food science. Natural antioxidants neutralize free radicals in food systems, as well as in human body. The antioxidant properties of seaweed have attracted scientific attention for many years. However, most experiments featured non-polar extracts while aqueous extracts still remain understudied. The present research objective was to evaluate the antioxidant properties of hydrothermal extracts of edible seaweed from the Northern Coast of the Sea of Japan. Study objects and methods. The study featured hot-water and autoclave (30 and 60 min) extracts of three edible seaweed species from Russia's Far East. The research focused on dry matter yield, total phenol content, phenolic profile, antiradical properties, hydroxylion (OH’) scavenging activity, and superoxide radical (O2“) scavenging activity. Results and discussion. The hot-water extracts appeared to have a higher yield than the autoclave extracts. The hot-water extract of red-purple seaweed Gracilaria verrucosa had the highest yield - 15.90%. The extract of brown seaweed Sargassum miyabei demonstrated the highest total phenol content. The phenolic profile of the extracts revealed 10 compounds, syringic acid and epicatechin being the major ones. The radical scavenging activity of the extracts varied from 48.2 to 88.9%, the highest value was observed in the hot-water extract of S. miyabei. The autoclave S. miyabei extracts also had a high radical scavenging activity, which exceeded other samples by 5.0-13.3%. The hot-water (30 min) extract of G. verrucosa had the lowest antiradical activity. Hot-water and autoclave extracts of S. miyabei showed the best OH’ scavenging activity. Only the samples of G. verrucosa demonstrated signs of superoxide radical scavenging. Conclusion. The extracts of brown seaweed S. miyabei proved to be the most active. The hot-water and autoclave extracts had the highest total phenol content and the strongest DPPH and OH’ inhibitory activity. © 2021 Tabakaev et al.

We investigated the effects of two brown edible seaweeds, Laminaria digitata (LD) and Undaria pinnatifida (UP), on postprandial glucose metabolism and appetite following a starch load in a human meal study. Methods: Twenty healthy subjects were enrolled in a randomized, 3-way, blinded cross-over trial. The study was registered under ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier no. NCT00123456. At each test day, the subjects received one of three meals comprising 30 g of starch with 5 g of LD or UP or an energy-adjusted control meal containing pea protein. Fasting and postprandial blood glucose, insulin, C-peptide and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) concentrations were measured. Subjective appetite sensations were scored using visual analogue scales (VAS). Results: Linear mixed model (LMM) analysis showed a lower blood glucose, insulin and C-peptide response following the intake of LD and UP, after correction for body weight. Participants weighing ≤ 63 kg had a reduced glucose response compared to control meal between 40 and 90 min both following LD and UP meals. Furthermore, LMM analysis for C-peptide showed a significantly lower response after intake of LD. Compared to the control meal, GLP-1 response was higher after the LD meal, both before and after the body weight adjustment. The VAS scores showed a decreased appetite sensation after intake of the seaweeds. Ad-libitum food intake was not different three hours after the seaweed meals compared to control.

Three edible seaweeds Fucus, Cystoseira, and Laminaria were used in the study. Different meat products with addition of seaweeds were prepared. Selenium concentration was measured using diaminonaphtalene method. Content of iodine was determined by inverse voltammetry. Results and discussion. Meat-based food products prepared with seaweeds to enrich them with iodine and selenium were proposed. Seaweed Laminaria had too high iodine and selenium contents to be used for preparation of dietary products. Cystoseira was the better source of iodine than Fucus. All ready-To-eat products with Cystoseira had higher iodine content than ones with Fucus. Iodine losses were lower and the contents of iodine in ready-To-eat products were higher in the products prepared at lower temperature 100 110 °C (steamed cutlets) in comparison with 170 °C (fried cutlets). Altogether, method used for product preparation had a great influence on iodine losses during cooking. The biggest losses were observed for products prepared in liquid: 50% iodine losses in meat balls braised in sauce and 61% in quenelles cooked in soup. Loss of iodine in dumpling was lower, 38%, maybe due to protection of meat with the dough cover. The lowest loss of iodine, around 17%, was in grilled sausages due to relatively low temperature of cooking and absence of liquid environment. Cystoseira was a lit bit better source of selenium than Fucus. All ready-To-eat products with Cystoseira had slightly higher selenium content than ones with Fucus. Influence of temperature and method for food preparation was not so evident, selenium losses varied from 19 to 27% for steam cutlets, meat balls and even for quenelles and dumpling prepared with Laminaria. The lowest loss of selenium, around 7%, was in the grilled sausages. Conclusion.

Objective: We tested the hypothesis that dietary supplementation with either Pacific dulse (Palmaria mollis, red algae) or wakame (Undaria pinnatifida, brown algae) could remediate metabolic complications in high-fat diet-induced obesity. Methods: Individually caged C57BL/6J mice (n = 8) were fed ad libitum with either a low-fat diet (LFD), 10% kcal fat; high-fat diet (HFD), 60% kcal fat; HFD + 5% (wt:wt) dulse (HFD + D); or HFD + 5% (wt:wt) wakame (HFD + W) for 8 weeks. Food intake and weight gain were monitored weekly. Glucose tolerance, hepatic lipids, fecal lipids, and plasma markers were evaluated, and the gut microbiome composition was assessed. Results: Despite the tendency of higher food and caloric intake than the HFD (P = 0.04) group, the HFD + D group mice did not exhibit higher body weight, indicating lower food and caloric efficiency (P 0.001). Sea vegetable supplementation reduced plasma monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP-1) (P 0.001) and increased fecal lipid excretion (P 0.001). Gut microbiome analysis showed that the HFD + D group had higher alpha-diversity than the HFD or LFD group, whereas beta-diversity analyses indicated that sea vegetablea-supplemented HFD-fed mice (HFD + D and HFD + W groups) developed microbiome compositions more similar to those of the LFD-fed mice than those of the HFD-fed mice.

Some studies have reported a growing interest in seaweeds among consumers in some European countries; furthermore, there have recently been initiatives in the field of gastronomy to open up new prospects for the future consumption of edible seaweed. Within this context, this study aims to explore Italian consumer attitudes and perceptions of edible seaweed and to profile them in clusters based on different characteristics. Data were collected from a sample of 257 Italian consumers by using a web-based survey. Principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to reduce the number of variables and a hierarchical cluster analysis was performed on the PCA scores. The study findings showed that 76% of the sample were willing to eat seaweed. This this may be due to a familiarity with some traditional Italian dishes that use seaweed or to the spread of Asian gastronomy in the country. This willingness to consume seaweed may indicate that consumers are becoming more receptive to novel foods, in particular those that are healthy options or are more sustainable food alternatives. However, only 57% of respondents had eaten seaweed once in the past. The profiling of the sample produced an optimal solution with seven clusters based on different food habits and attitudes towards edible seaweed. This could be useful for developing the sector and promoting seaweed consumption. In five out of seven clusters, ranging from those with a very good to a poor conception of seaweed, consumers consistently paid attention to the health characteristics of food. For several clusters, seaweed characteristics and seaweed availability were revealed as important drivers for influencing consumer attitudes. More information about the health and organoleptic characteristics of seaweed should be at the center of any marketing tools aimed at promoting consumer acceptance. Such tools should also address main factors that could lead consumption choices and policy action such as including edible seaweed within recommended dietary guidelines. Furthermore, the development of the culinary and gastronomic potential of seaweed could be useful for increasing consumption amongst present and future consumers in western countries.

RESULTS: More than 100 volatile compounds were identified by static headspace solid phase micro-extraction (HS-SPME) and thermal desorption gas chromatography – mass spectrometry (TD GC–MS). Brown seaweeds were characterized by ‘grassy/herbal/floral’, ‘fruity’, and ‘fatty’ aromas, red seaweeds by ‘green/vegetable’, ‘mushroom/earthy’ and ‘sweet/buttery’ aromas, and the fucoxanthin extract by ‘rancid’ and ‘nutty’ aromas with an overall lower intensity. Heptanal appeared to be a major odor-active compound in all samples. Other volatiles were more characteristic of each individual seaweed: hexanal, (E,Z)-2,6-nonadienal and 2-pentylfuran for H. elongata; ethyl butanoate and 2,3-butanedione for U. pinnatifida; 6-dimethylpyrazine, (E,Z)-2,6-nonadienal and sulactone for P. palmata; 1-octen-3-ol for P. umbilicalis, heptanone for A. esculenta, and 2-furanmethanol for fucoxanthin.

Pesticide quantification was performed in surface water, sediment, macroalgae (Ulva spp., Gracilaria gracilis, Fucus vesiculosus), aquatic plants (Zostera noltii, Spartina maritime, Scirpus maritimus) and bivalves (Scrobicularia plana). Since intense precipitation could promote the runoff of pesticides from the surrounding agricultural fields, a single long-duration flood event was also studied in this estuarine system. Under normal flow conditions, quantified concentrations were determined mostly during summer in agreement with the pesticide application period. Azoxystrobin presented the highest detection frequency and atrazine (an herbicide used globally but banned in the EU) presented the second highest frequency, thus highlighting the need to include legacy pesticides in monitoring programmes. Pesticide concentrations in surface water determined in the present study suggest low risk to estuarine organisms. However, all the pesticides were bioaccumulated by S. plana, leading us to consider that pesticides may not only cause adverse effects on the aquatic organism itself, but should also be an alert for human exposure, for this is an edible species and is considered of economic interest. Concern is also expressed about edible seaweeds, since s-triazine pesticides were found in Ulva spp. and G. gracilis. Acknowledging these concerns, developing and establishing allowable pesticide safety values for edible seaweeds and bivalves is recommended, as well as monitoring bivalve pesticide levels, using the whole animal, as a human health exposure indicator for estuarine systems.

Lactobacilli are normal residents of the gastrointestinal tract of pigs, and many of them are able to exert beneficial immunoregulatory properties. On the other hand, wakame (Undaria pinnafida), an edible seaweed, has the potential to be used as an immunoregulatory prebiotic when added to livestock feed. Therefore, in order to develop a novel immunosynbiotic, we isolated and characterized immunoregulatory lactobacilli with the ability to utilize wakame. Following a month-long in vivo wakame feeding trial in 8-week-old Landrace pigs (n = 6), sections of intestinal mucous membrane were processed for bacteriological culture and followed by identification of pure colonies by 16S rRNA sequence. Each isolate was characterized in vitro in terms of their ability to assimilate to the wakame and to differentially modulate the expression of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interferon beta (IFN-β) in the porcine intestinal epithelial (PIE) cells triggered by Toll-like receptor (TLR)-4 and TLR-3 activation, respectively. We demonstrated that feeding wakame to pigs significantly increased the lactobacilli population in the small intestine. We established a wakame-component adjusted culture media that allowed the isolation and characterization of a total of 128 Lactobacilli salivarius colonies from the gut of wakame-fed pigs. Interestingly, several L. salivarius isolates showed both high wakame assimilation ability and immunomodulatory capacities. Among the wakame assimilating isolates, L. salivarius FFIG71 showed a significantly higher capacity to upregulate the IL-6 expression, and L. salivarius FFIG131 showed significantly higher capacity to upregulate the IFN-β expression; these could be used as immunobiotic strains in combination with wakame for the development of novel immunologically active feeds for pigs. © 2019 by the authors.

Daily food intake has much impact on the quality of life, and therefore inclusion of functional foods is now essential to our diet. Nutraceuticals are neither food nor drug but are added to food to provide extra nutritional and physiological properties. Though nutraceutical compounds provide minimal actions, their regular involvement in the diet can provide major and long-term health benefits. Global demand for additional and sustainable biomass for the production of important metabolites with nutraceutical potential has resulted in renewed interest in seaweeds. Seaweeds have been consumed from ancient times in Asian areas, and in recent times they have been demonstrated to possess many medicinal effects. Seaweeds are considered a rich source of various nutritional ingredients and metabolites that have pharmaceutical properties. It has been observed that total protein, from terrestrial plants such as soybean and wheat, produces an allergic response on consumption. Therefore, seaweed proteins can be considered a promising source for food industries. Overall, seaweeds are a rich source of PUFAs, metabolites, proteins, sulfated polysaccharides, vitamins, and minerals, which are all responsible for different bioactivities; they are therefore considered a promising functional food (nutraceutical). In this review we discuss the nutraceutical potential of seaweeds regarding different metabolites (primary and secondary), variation in composition, probable biological applications, limitations, research gaps, and future prospects. © 2018 Institute of Food Technologists®\r",{"entities":[]}],["The edible seaweed Gelidium elegans (GEE) is known to inhibit adipocyte differentiation.

Administration of 1% wakame significantly decreased serum total cholesterol levels. Hepatic gene expression was investigated using DNA microarray analysis, and the results showed that wakame suppresses the lipogenic pathway by downregulating SREBF-1. Moreover, bile acid biosynthesis and gluconeogenesis were promoted by upregulation of the PPAR signaling pathway, which leads to a reduction in the accumulation of cholesterol and promotion of β-oxidation.

Seaweeds may be one of the last natural food resources abundantly available. They are known to contain many compounds which may have additional functional benefits. This edible seaweed is characterized by high content of nutrients including carbohydrates and polyphenols, which are recognized antioxidants. Because their natural environment is a 3% saline solution, they are very resistant to mild extraction methods. However, extracts from solvent extractions usually contain residual solvents, making them unacceptable for high quality functional foods and high end cosmetics. The objective of this study was to test the biological properties of three extracts from sugar kelp (Saccharina latissima). Methods: Cold water, hot water, and ethanol: water (70:30 v/v) extracts were prepared. Total Carbohydrate Content (TCC) was determined by the phenol – sulphuric acid method and values were expressed as mg of fucose/g of dry extract. Total Polyphenol Content (TPC) was determined and expressed as mg of Gallic Acid Equivalent (GAE)/100g of dry extract. Oxygen Radical Absorbance Capacity (ORAC) assay was performed for all extracts and values were expressed as µM of Trolox® Equivalent/g of dry extract. Human leukemia monocytic cell line (THP-1) was used to investigate the bioactivity of Saccharina extracts. Extracts were applied to PMA differentiated THP-1 cells. Cytotoxicity of derived extracts was assessed by light microscopy followed by XTT proliferation assay. Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent assays (ELISA) were performed to determine secretion of interleukin – 10 (IL-10), tumor necrosis factor – α (TNF-α) and interleukin – 6 (IL-6). Results: The cold water extract exhibited very toxic properties toward macrophages and was thereby excluded from the experimental proceedings with use of the macrophages. Among all the tested extracts, the hot water extract was richest in sugars (682±243 mg fucose/g dry extract) and polyphenols (96.5±5.6 mg GAE/g dry extract), which was correlated to the determined ORAC values (1686±99 μM TE/g dry extract). The addition of hot water and ethanol extracts at concentrations 100 μg/ml triggered secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-α suggesting immunomodulatory properties of Saccharina extracts toward macrophages. Conclusions: The present study suggests that carbohydrate enriched extracts from Icelandic edible seaweed Saccharina latissima have antioxidant and immunomodulatory properties towards human THP–1 derived macrophages. The carbohydrate and polyphenol correlated with ORAC values confirming antioxidant properties of the derived extracts. The hot water extract affected the pro–inflammatory (TNF–α) and anti–inflammatory (IL–10) cytokine secretion in macrophages, suggesting their bioactivity through immunomodulatory actions and can be considered for practical applications in functional foods and cosmetics. © 2019 Functional Foods in Health and Disease.

The administration of the extract in a diet particularly rich in fat is associated with a delay in carbohydrate digestion, but also with a decrease in its assimilation. In conclusion, our results indicate that this algal extract may be useful in the control of carbohydrate digestion and absorption.

Like other food types, during their storage there are significant changes in sensory characteristics associated with loss of freshness and with production and/or degradation of their volatile compounds. In this study, multiple headspace sorptive extraction (MHSSE) coupled with gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) detection has been applied to an edible green seaweed (Ulva rigida) in order to determine the evolution of volatile compounds during storage for 12 days at 4 or 16 °C. RESULTS: The existing analytical methodology has been updated and validated for 18 additional compounds. At the end, 41 volatile compounds from different chemical families were quantified. Aldehydes, carboxylic acids and esters were the main classes found in U. rigida. Analytical and sensory data were submitted for statistical analysis. During storage, most volatile compounds were only affected by the number of storage days (P < 0.05), with significant decreases as storage time increased. Sensory analysis revealed significant changes in the samples stored for longer times (8, 10 and 12 days), with a clear influence of the boiled vegetable descriptor. CONCLUSION: In order to get a successful preservation of seaweeds and to maintain their marine character during storage, both temperature and time should be carefully controlled. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry\r",{"entities":[[509,520,"SEAWEED"],[881,891,"SEAWEED"]]}],["Gracilaria is the second most productive genus of mariculture seaweeds after Laminaria in China.

Here, we investigated the anti-inflammatory effect of indole-4-carboxaldehyde (ST-I4C), which was isolated from the edible seaweed Sargassum thunbergii, on MGO-induced inflammation in HepG2 cells, a human hepatocyte cell line. ST-I4C attenuated the MGO-induced expression of inflammatory-related genes, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and IFN-γ by activating nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) without toxicity in HepG2 cells. In addition, ST-I4C reduced the MGO-induced AGE formation and the expression of the receptor for AGE (RAGE). Interestingly, both the mRNA and protein expression levels of Glo-1 increased following ST-I4C treatment, and the decrease in Glo-1 mRNA expression caused by MGO exposure was rescued by ST-I4C pretreatment.

Wakame is rich in dietary fiber. Despite the long history of its intake, changes in the intestinal environment following the ingestion of wakame are unclear. The aim of this study is to investigate the daily consumption of wakame and test the possibility of wakame use as a probiotic. Methods: We examined the effect of a 2-week intake of wakame on defecation frequency and the intestinal microbiota of 22 healthy individuals suffering from low defecation frequency. The clinical trial was designed as an open-label study. Results: Defecation frequency, defined in terms of times per week, days per week, and volume per week, significantly increased during the wakame intake period. Furthermore, based on terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP), the fraction of bifidobacteria as a percentage of all fecal bacteria increased significantly during the wakame intake period. At the phylum, next-generation sequencing (NGS) revealed that the relative abundance of Actinobacteria after wakame intake significantly increased while the abundance of Bacteroidetes decreased. Moreover, species-level analyses revealed that the abundance of Bifidobacterium longum increased significantly after wakame intake. B. longum colony counts on wakame-containing medium were significantly higher than those on medium lacking wakame. Conclusion: These observations suggest that wakame intake improves intestinal environment and increases the fecal population of bifidobacteria, indicating that it may have prebiotic properties. © 2018 Functional Foods in Health and Disease.

Phylogenetic trees and network analysis consistently revealed three major haplotype groups (A, B, and C) in S. fusiforme, with A and B distributed in the Japan-Pacific coast. Group C consisted of three subgroups (C1, C2, and C3) which were distributed in the Sea of Japan, the Yellow–Bohai Sea, and East China Sea, respectively. Isolation-with-migration (IMa) analysis revealed that the three groups diverged approximately during the mid-Pleistocene (c. 756–1,224 ka). Extended Bayesian skyline plots (EBSP) showed that groups A and B underwent relatively long-term stable population size despite a subsequent rapid demographic expansion, while subgroups C2 and C3 underwent a sudden expansion at c. 260 ka.

Despite this variability, accumulation of Mg, and especially Fe, seems to be prevalent in Chlorophyta, while Rhodophyta and Phaeophyta accumulate higher concentrations of Mn and I, respectively. Both red and brown seaweeds also tend to accumulate higher concentrations of Na, K, and Zn than green seaweeds. Their valuable mineral content grants them great potential for application in the food industry as new ingredients for the development of numerous functional food products. Indeed, many studies have already shown that seaweeds can be used as NaCl replacers in common foods while increasing their content in elements that are oftentimes deficient in European population. In turn, high concentrations of some elements, such as I, need to be carefully addressed when evaluating seaweed consumption, since excessive intake of this element was proven to have negative impacts on health. In this regard, studies point out that although very bioaccessible, I bioavailability seems to be low, contrarily to other elements, such as Na, K, and Fe. Another weakness of seaweed consumption is their capacity to accumulate several toxic metals, which can pose some health risks. Therefore, considering the current great expansion of seaweed consumption by the Western population, specific regulations on this subject should be laid down.

In Okinawa, raw mozuku is eaten as vinegared mozuku together with vinegar or as tempura (deep-fried in batter). Polysaccharides such as fucoidan are generally known to regulate intestinal function, which is why we have used Okinawa mozuku to investigate this intestinal regulatory effect. Methods: The study was designed as a randomized, double-blind, parallel group study. Dried Okinawa mozuku powder at a dose of 2.4 g/day (1.0 g/day of fucoidan) and a placebo not containing any dried Okinawa mozuku powder were each made into capsules and given to healthy men and women with infrequent weekly bowel movements (2-4 movements a week) to ingest for eight weeks. We then investigated changes in the defecation situation, blood tests, and adverse events. Results: In the group that ingested the capsules containing dried Okinawa mozuku powder, the number of days with a bowel movement significantly increased compared with the placebo group after four weeks of ingestion (p < 0.05). Furthermore, after eight weeks of ingestion, the same increasing trend was seen compared with the placebo group (p = 0.0964). The volume of stool also increased significantly in the dried Okinawa mozuku powder group after eight weeks compared with the placebo group. In terms of blood tests and adverse events, no adverse events occurred that were the result of the test food. Conclusion: Ingestion of Okinawa mozuku was found to have a regulatory effect on intestinal function by promoting defecation in healthy individuals with a tendency for constipation. This demonstrated that Okinawa mozuku is a functional food capable of making defecation smoother and increasing the volume of stool. © 2017 Functional Food Institute.

A phlorotannin-enriched fraction (TRF) purified from the PRE was more potent with an IC50 = 60 μg GAE per assay (∼65 μg DW). When the assay was started by the addition of lipase, both Orlistat and TRF were much less effective which suggests that pre-incubation of enzyme and inhibitor improved inhibition. Based on phenol content, water extracts from Ascophyllum were more potent lipase inhibitors than PRE (IC50 ∼ 150 μg GAE per assay). However, this was equivalent to ∼580 μg DW and these extracts contained polysaccharides (e.g. alginate content = 110 μg mL-1) which may also contribute to inhibition. Indeed, a polysaccharide-enriched fraction obtained by ethanol precipitation gave an IC50 of 1000 μg DW which was equivalent to 130 μg GAE and 420 μg alginate per assay. Therefore a >3 fold increase in alginate content did not markedly improve inhibition. Re-precipitation increased alginate content and reduced polyphenol content but lipase inhibition was markedly reduced (i.e. IC50 at ∼1100 μg DW per assay, 700 μg alginate and 25 μg GAE). Purifying the polysaccharide fraction by ion exchange removed all phenolics but the IC50 increased to >2500 μg DW, equivalent to >1970 μg alginate per assay.

The effects of seawater storage on the chemical composition (i.e., mineral fraction, carbohydrates, proteins, polyphenols, and fucoxanthin) and surface color of two cultivated kelps (Phaeophyceae), Alaria esculenta and Saccharina latissima, were investigated over a 22-h period. Storage treatments resulted in a rapid decrease in dry weight during the first 2 h (−21.4 and −20.4% in A. esculenta and S. latissima, respectively) with subsequent stabilization. Although it is not clear whether the reduction of dry weight was caused by the release of nutritional compounds from seaweed biomass or water uptake during storage treatment, the results from chemical analyses suggest the combined effect of both mechanisms. Seawater storage increased the ash and sodium contents and reduced carbohydrate and polyphenol levels in both species. Among carbohydrates, the levels of mannitol and glucose (laminaran) were particularly reduced in S. latissima samples while the fucose level, reflecting fucoidans, was reduced in A. esculenta.

As expected, the RAD-seq panel showed more power than the microsatellite panel for identifying fine-grained patterns. However, both panels demonstrated habitat-specific properties of the study populations. In particular, farms displayed very low genetic diversity and no inbreeding conversely to populations in marinas and natural rocky reefs. In addition, strong, but chaotic regional genetic structure, was revealed, consistent with human-mediated dispersal (e.g., leisure boating).

Other, less well known biological properties have also been described for algal polysaccharides, including an effect on lipid metabolism and glucose concentration and antiinflammatory, antiproliferative, antimicrobial, liver-protecting, and prebiotic effects. The addition of edible seaweeds or seaweed-derived ingredients to traditional foods can be considered a good strategy for increasing the value of the functional foods market. © 2014 by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

A sample pre-treatment based on ultrasound assisted enzymatic hydrolysis was optimized for the extraction of these iodinated amino acids. Pancreatin was selected as the most adequate type of enzyme, and parameters affecting the extraction efficiency (pH, temperature, mass of enzyme and extraction time) were evaluated by univariate approaches. In addition, extractable inorganic iodine (iodide) was also quantified by anion exchange high performance liquid chromatography (AE-HPLC) coupled with ICP-MS. The proposed procedure offered limits of detection of 1.1 and 4.3ngg-1 for MIT and DIT, respectively. Total iodine contents in seaweed, as well as total iodine in enzymatic digests were measured by ICP-MS after microwave assisted alkaline digestion with tetramethylamonium hydroxide (TMAH) for total iodine assessment, and also by treating the pancreatin extracts (extractable total iodine assessment). The optimized procedure was successfully applied to five different types of edible seaweed. The highest total iodine content, and also the highest iodide levels, was found in the brown seaweed Kombu (6646±45μgg-1). Regarding iodinated amino acids, Nori (a red seaweed) was by far the one with the highest amount of both species (42±3 and 0.41±0.024μgg-1 for MIT and DIT, respectively). In general, MIT concentrations were much higher than the amounts of DIT, which suggests that iodine from iodinated proteins in seaweed is most likely bound in the form of MIT residues. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.\r",{"entities":[]}],["Eucheuma denticulatum is a red edible seaweed that grows in the East Malaysia coastal region.

Because this pathogen has become resistant to sanitizers and other disinfectants that are used to clean utensils and surfaces during food processing, it poses a serious threat to the food industry. Objectives: The study was conducted to determine the anti-listerial potential of essential oils extracted from four edible seaweeds against L. monocytogenes. Materials and Methods: Essential oil was extracted from four edible seaweeds (Enteromorpha linza, Undaria pinnatifida, Laminaria japonica, and Porphyra tenera) against L. monocytogenes using the microwave hydrodistillation method. The anti-listerial activity of the essential oil was determined using the standard disc diffusion method. Results: Among the four essential oils, E. linza (ELEO) was most effective against all three strains of L. monocytogenes (11.3 - 16.0 mm). The other three essential oils were only effective against two strains, L. monocytogenes ATCC 19115 (10.0 - 10.5 mm) and L. monocytogenes ATCC 7644 (11.0 - 15.0 mm). The minimum inhibitory concentration and the minimum bactericidal concentration of all four essential oils varied from 12.5 - 25.0 mg/mL. Further, the mode of action of ELEO against L. monocytogenes was investigated by examining its effect on cell viability, the release of 260-nm absorbing materials, the number of K+ ions, the relative electrical conductivity, and the salt tolerance capacity. The results indicated that the essential oils exhibited strong anti-listerial activity against multiple strains of L. monocytogenes. It displayed potential inhibitory effects on the viability of bacterial cells and loss of integrity as indicated by an increase in the relative electrical conductivity, leakage of K+ ions and other 260-nm absorbing materials, and a loss of the salt tolerance capacity. Conclusions: The results presented herein provided insight into a possible explanation for the modes of action of essential oils on L. monocytogenes.

In addition, monosaccharide composition showed that ultrasound promotes the extraction of polysaccharides other than SP. In the prothrombin time (PT) test, which evaluates the extrinsic coagulation pathway, none of the samples showed anticoagulant activity. While in the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) test, which evaluates the intrinsic coagulation pathway, all samples showed anticoagulant activity, except GB2s. The aPTT activity decreased in the order of GB1sp > GB2sp > GB1 > GB1s > GB2s. The total capacity antioxidant (TCA) of the SP was also affected by extraction condition, since GB2s and GB1 showed lower activity in comparison to the other conditions.

Wild-gathered seaweeds (limu) are a prominent component of Native Hawaiian diet and culture, but are understudied for their nutritional benefits and contemporary cultural use. This study uses a combination of ethnographic, pharmacological, and ecological approaches to document contemporary levels of wild seaweed gathering and consumption, and it explores the impact of cultivation and eutrophication on the disease-preventive benefits wild seaweeds may provide. Levels of gathering and consumption of seaweed were assessed with surveys of high school students and interviews with adult limu gatherers on O'ahu island, Hawai'i. Antioxidant activity was assessed with laboratory-based assays. Almost all students surveyed reported consuming cultivated seaweeds, one-third reported having consumed wild seaweeds, and one-fifth had gathered them, confirming that gathering practice and traditional diet have persisted in Hawai'i despite major social and environmental change. Wild gathering was three times as high and consumption 60% more prevalent among Native Hawaiians compared to non-Hawaiian students. Further, students with a parent who gathered limu were six times more likely to have gathered limu themselves, asserting the importance of within-family transmission to cultural continuity. A larger proportion of male than female Hawaiian students reported gathering wild seaweeds, indicating a cultural shift from pre-Contact Hawai'i, when women were the predominant gatherers and consumers of limu. The wild seaweeds assessed demonstrated higher levels of antioxidant activity than did cultivated seaweeds. Eutrophication was correlated with a decline in antioxidant activity, indicating that changing ocean conditions may alter the nutritional quality of this traditional food. Today, nearly all students are receiving some antioxidant benefits from seaweed, with Native Hawaiian youth from families that gather seaweed most likely to receive this health benefit.

The major machinery that the cell employs to neutralize excess ROS is through the activation of the antioxidant-response element (ARE) that controls the activation of many phase II detoxification enzymes. The transcription factor that recognizes the ARE, Nrf2, can be activated by a variety of small molecules, most of which contain an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl system. In the pursuit of chemopreventive agents from marine organisms, we built, fractionated, and screened a library of 30 field-collected eukaryotic algae from Florida. An edible green alga, Ulva lactuca, yielded multiple active fractions by ARE-luciferase reporter assay. We isolated three monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) derivatives as active components, including a new keto-type C18 fatty acid (1), the corresponding shorter chain C16 acid (2), and an amide derivative (3) of the C18 acid. Their chemical structures were elucidated by NMR and mass spectrometry. All three contain the conjugated enone motif between C7 and C9, which is thought to be responsible for the ARE activity. Subsequent biological studies focused on 1, the most active and abundant ARE activator isolated. C18 acid 1 induced the expression of ARE-regulated cytoprotective genes, including NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1, heme oxygenase 1, thioredoxin reductase 1, both subunits of the glutamate-cysteine ligase (catalytic subunit and modifier subunit), and the cystine/glutamate exchange transporter, in IMR-32 human neuroblastoma cells. Its cellular activity requires the presence of Nrf2 and PI3K function, based on RNA interference and pharmacological inhibitor studies, respectively. Treatment with 1 led only to Nrf2 activation, and not the increase in production of NRF2 mRNA. To test its ARE activity and cytoprotective potential in vivo, we treated mice with a single dose of a U. lactuca fraction that was enriched with 1, which showed ARE-activating effects similar to those observed in vitro. This could be owing to this fraction's ability to stabilize Nrf2 through inhibition of Keap1-mediated Nrf2 ubiquitination and the subsequent accumulation and nuclear translocation of Nrf2. The induction of many ARE-driven antioxidant genes in vivo and most prominently in the heart agreed with the commonly recognized cardioprotective properties of MUFAs. A significant increase in Nqo1 transcript levels was also found in other mouse tissues such as the brain, lung, and stomach.

Therefore, in the present study, essential oil from an edible seaweed, Enteromorpha linza (AEO), was evaluated for its antibacterial activity against foodborne pathogens, along with the mechanism of its antibacterial action. AEO at 25 mg/disc was highly active against Bacillus cereus (12.3-12.7 mm inhibition zone) and Staphylococcus aureus (12.7-13.3 mm inhibition zone). The minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal concentration values of AEO ranged from 12.5-25 mg/mL. Further investigation of the mechanism of action of AEO revealed its strong impairing effect on the viability of bacterial cells and membrane permeability, as indicated by a significant increase in leakage of 260 nm absorbing materials and K+ ions from the cell membrane and loss of high salt tolerance.

We found that exposure of cortical cultured neurons or PC12 cells to Aβ resulted in neuronal cell death, whereas pre-treatment with fucoxanthin reduced Aβ-induced cell death.

A major source of iodine intake in Japan is from edible seaweeds, and it is reported to be among the highest in the world. We examined the association between seaweed intake frequency and the risk of thyroid cancer in women in the Japan Collaborative Cohort Study followed from 1988 to 2009. Seaweed intake, together with other lifestyle-related information was collected using a self-administered questionnaire at baseline. Seaweed intake frequency was categorized as follows: 1-2 times/week or less, 3-4 times/week, and almost daily. Hazard ratios and the 95% confidence intervals of thyroid cancer incidence according to seaweed intake frequency were estimated using Cox proportional hazards regression. During 447 876 person-years of follow-up (n=35 687), 94 new cases of thyroid cancer were identified. The crude incidence rate was 20.9 per 100 000 personyears. The hazard ratio of thyroid cancer in women who consumed seaweed daily compared with women who ate it 1-2 times/week or less was 1.15 (95% confidence interval: 0.69-1.90, P for trend= 0.59). Further analyses did not indicate any association between seaweed intake and the risk of thyroid cancer on statistically adjusting for potential confounding variables as well as on stratification by menopausal status.

Findings: Results have shown that the addition of KA increased the hardness and chewiness parameters, water holding capacity, redness (a*-value) and the pH value of the MDCM sausages (p<0.05). The adhesiveness, cohesiveness and springiness of all formulations showed no significant differences (p>0.05). The addition of KA reduced the cooking loss of MDCM sausages (p<0.05). However, the addition of KA made the sausages darker (lower L*-value) (p<0.05). Furthermore, the addition of KA aided in the reduction of lipid oxidation in the MDCM sausages when they were refrigerated at a temperature of 4°C for 12 days. The MDCM sausages that contained KA had lower two-thiobarbituric acid test values compared to the control sample (p<0.05) during the 12 days of storage at 4°C.

The results indicated that the biosorption of Cd2+ depended on the initial Cd2+ concentration, as well as the pH. The uptake of Cd2+ could be described by the Langmuir isotherm model, and both the Langmuir biosorption equilibrium constant and the maximum biosorption capacity of the monolayer decreased with increasing temperature, thereby confirming the exothermic character of the sorption process.

Mice were fed a high fat control (HFC) or normal fat control (NFC) diet for 10 weeks. The HF diet-fed group was administered a HF diet containing WLs for a further 5 weeks.

Dietary administration of the HF diet resulted in hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia and hyperleptinemia in the mouse model. These perturbations were completely normalized in the HF-WL diet-fed group. Increased expression of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) mRNA expression was observed in HFC mice, but was normalized in the HF-WL groups. Moreover, the HF-WL diet promoted mRNA expression of β3-adrenergic receptor (Adrb3) in WAT and glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) mRNA in skeletal muscle tissues.

The present study was undertaken to elucidate the pharmacological and biological effects of E. stolonifera extracts on the production of inflammatory mediators in macrophages. The results indicate that the hexane fraction of E. stolonifera extract (ESH) is an effective inhibitor of lipopolysccharide (LPS)-induced NO, prostaglandin E2, and proinflammatory cytokine production in RAW 264. 7 cells. These inhibitory effects of ESH were accompanied by decreases in the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase-2 proteins. Furthermore, ESH inhibited the LPS-induced phosphorylation and degradation of IκB-α, which is required for the nuclear translocations of the p50 and p65 nuclear transcription factor kappa-B (NF-κB) subunits in RAW 264.7 cells. Our results suggest that ESH might exert an anti-inflammatory effect by inhibiting the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Such an effect is mediated by a blocking of NF-κB activation, which consequently inhibits the generation of inflammatory mediators in RAW264. 7 cells.

Thus, a simple, reliable and fast HPSEC method with refractive index detection was developed and optimized for the MW estimation of soluble algal polysaccharides. Chromatogram shape and repeatability of retention time was considerably improved when sodium nitrate was used instead of ultrapure water as mobile phase. Pullulan and dextran standards of different MW were used for method calibration and validation. Also, main polysaccharide standards from brown (alginate, fucoidan, laminaran) and red seaweeds (kappa- and iota-carrageenan) were used for quantification and method precision and accuracy. Relative standard deviation (RSD) of repeatability for retention time, peak areas and inter-day precision was below 0.7%, 2.5% and 2.6%, respectively, which indicated good repeatability and precision. Recoveries (96.3-109.8%) also showed its fairly good accuracy. Regarding linearity, main polysaccharide standards from brown or red seaweeds showed a highly satisfactory correlation coefficient (r > 0.999). Moreover, a good sensitivity was shown, with corresponding limits of detection and quantitation in mg/mL of 0.05-0.21 and 0.16-0.31, respectively.

Although distribution of molecular weight was broad, the good repeatability for retention time provided a good precision in MW estimation of polysaccharides. Water- and alkali-soluble fractions from S. latissima ranged from very high (>2400 kDa) to low MW compounds (<6 kDa); this high heterogeneity could be attributable to the complex polysaccharide composition of brown algae. Regarding M. stellatus, sulfated galactans followed a descending order of MW (>1400 kDa to <10 kDa), related to the different solubility of carrageenans in red seaweeds.

As part of the screening process, growth of the LAB was carried out on raw and heat treated forms of seaweeds. The seaweed species in their raw state could not support the growth of L. plantarum. Heat treatment resulted in almost 4 times increase in the total sugar content in L. digitata and L. saccharina broth which allowed the growth of L. plantarum for 24 h after which the cell number started decreasing.

The laver is the nutritious seaweed, which included functionality materials such as taurine, lutein, carotenoid, eicosapentaenoic acid, and unique polysaccharides (Yoshizawa et al.; 1995, Tao et al., 2008) as well as various vitamins and minerals. The laver is also expected as protein source because it includes about 40% protein per dried material-the same as the soy bean, which is called King of the plant proteins. Since the British botanist Kathleen Mary Drew-Baker discovered in 1949, that Conchocelis was the diploid stage of Porphyra (Drew 1949), full-scale culture of laver began in Japan. After that, selective breeding of the laver was performed, and Porphyra yezoensis is cultivated widely now. However, in late years, marine environment turns worse with landfill or the shore protection works of near shore waters and gives laver culture the big damage by outbreak such as discoloration and red rot disease. In such a background, breeding of the laver of high quality having superior growth and disease resistance is expected by using cell fusion and a gene manipulation (Craigle, 1991; Minocha, 2001; Punja, 2001; Chawla, 2002). Establishment of the isolation method of the protoplasts is important for breeding by these biotechnologies. In addition, the protoplasts that raise digestion by removing a cell wall attract attention as new feed material of the cultured fish (Kalla et al., 2008a and 2008b; Khan et al., 2008). However, the cell wall of the laver consists of β-1,4-mannan, β-1,3-xylan, and porphyran, so that protoplasts are not isolated from it with commercial cellulase and pectinase. Therefore, we tried to search bacteria that produce these cell wall-degrading enzymes such as β-1,4-mannanase, β-1,3-xylanase, and agarase capable of degrading porphyran, and characterized the properties of them. Subsequently, we examined a condition to isolate a large number of protoplasts from the laver with these enzymes.

For brown seaweeds, soluble fiber consists of uronic acids from alginates and neutral sugars from sulfated fucoidan and laminarin. For red seaweeds, main neutral sugars correspond to sulfated galactans such as carrageenan or agar. Insoluble fibers (7.4-40%) are essentially made of cellulose, with an important contribution of Klason lignin, up to 31% in Fucus. In Nori, insoluble fiber consists of a mannan and xylan. Protein content is generally higher in red (15-30%), than in brown seaweeds (7-26%), although protein digestibility is apparently low. Ash content is high (21-40%) and sulfate, related to the presence of sulfated polysaccharides, represents 7.4-57% of ash. Except for the brown seaweeds Fucus (2.5%) and Bifurcaria (5.6%), oil content is usually lower than 1%. Relevant biological properties of seaweeds (such as anticoagulant or antioxidant capacity) seem to be associated to sulfate content in sulfated polysaccharides and to a lesser degree to minor components, such as extractable polyphenols (0.4%). In brown seaweeds, the correlation among reduction power, radical-scavenging activity and total phenolic content would suggest the involvement of phenolic compounds in the antioxidant mechanisms, whereas in the case of red seaweeds, the role of sulfate-containing polysaccharides is presumably evidenced in the reduction power. It should be stressed that processing and storage conditions are essential for the optimal preservation of bioactive compounds (such as phenolic compounds and pigments) and their antioxidant activity. Regarding the main physicochemical properties of dietary fiber in seaweeds, related to the hydrophilic nature of sulfated polysaccharides, oil retention is low, while swelling, water retention, and cation exchange capacity are higher in brown than in red algae. Our results indicate that vibrational FTIR-ATR spectroscopy is a useful tool for a rapid and preliminary identification of the main natural phycocolloids (namely alginate, agar and carrageenan) in edible brown and red seaweeds. Moreover, other storage and structural polysaccharides in seaweeds such as laminarin, fucoidan and cellulose, as well as protein or sulfate, can be identified from specific absorption bands in their infrared spectra. Accordingly, alginate is the main polysaccharide in brown seaweeds, whereas all red seaweeds studied are carrageenan producers, except for Nori.

Many commercial collectors use a frond trimming method they claim is sustainable and allows for multiple collections per year. Unlike cutting at the stipe, which is lethal and can drive populations to extinction, frond trimming preserves the meristem, allowing fronds to regrow. To evaluate the ecological consequences of biomass loss and sustainability of this commercial take method we conducted 2 field experiments. We trimmed fronds at different frequencies and times and then measured: (1) frond regrowth and reproductive output and (2) population recruitment. We explored the potential for geographic variation by replicating the first experiment near the center and southern limit of Postelsia's biogeographic range. Fronds trimmed in April-June were able to regrow and eventually produce viable spores, albeit at somewhat reduced rates. However, spore production was sharply reduced when fronds were trimmed after the onset of sporogenesis (end of July), whether trimmed once or twice. These effects were similar across the geographic range examined but varied in magnitude. Recruitment was 38% greater in populations not subjected to trimming and population sizes were reduced by 40 to 50% when trimmed. A precautionary approach to management should: (1) mandate the frond trimming method, (2) limit collection to once a year and (3) close the commercial season before the onset of reproduction. © Inter-Research 2010.\r",{"entities":[[19,41,"SEAWEED"],[53,62,"SEAWEED"],[172,182,"LOCATION"],[935,944,"SEAWEED"]]}],["Seafood and seafood products contain high levels of arsenic, and for most people, seafood is the major source of arsenic exposure. In seafood, most arsenic is organically bound, and it is mainly found as arsenobetaine, which is considered nontoxic. Seafood generally contains low levels of inorganic arsenic, the most toxic form of arsenic, and the consumption of seafood contributes little to the dietary intake of inorganic arsenic. However, some types of seafood (e.g., some species of brown algae and bivalves) may contain high levels of inorganic arsenic. The consumption of edible seaweed or bivalves with an elevated level of inorganic arsenic may lead to an intake exceeding the provisional tolerable weekly intake (PTWI) of 0.015 mg per kg bodyweight. The potential risk of elevated levels of inorganic arsenic in some types of seafood must be recognized.

Materials and methods: Porphyra dentata crude extract was prepared with methanol. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) hyphenated to electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) and UV detection were utilized to analyze the extract fingerprints. Nitrite measurement, iNOS promoter activity and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) enhancer activity were used to assess the anti-inflammatory effect in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenged mouse RAW 264.7 cell line. Results: Phenolic compounds (catechol, rutin and hesperidin) were identified in the crude extract of Porphyra dentata.

The accuracy of the method was evaluated using various reference materials and found to be generally in agreement within ±6% of the certified values. The longitudinal distributions of iodine at different growing stages in Japanese sea mustard and tangle seaweeds were investigated. For a 150-cm-high tangle, the highest concentration (5,360 mg/kg) of iodine was found at the root, then decreased slowly to 780 mg/kg in the middle portion (60-75 cm), and increased to 2,300 mg/kg at the apex. On the other hand, for a 190-cm-high sea mustard the highest levels of iodine were found both at the roots (164 mg/kg) and apex (152 mg/kg) with lower values (98 mg/kg) in the middle section. In order to estimate the bioaccessible fraction of iodine, seaweeds were digested by an in vitro enzymolysis method, dietary fibre separated from residue, and both fractions analyzed by EINAA-CSS.

The intake of seaweed is a route to arsenic exposure. Due to the different toxic behaviors among arsenic species, speciation studies are a matter of vital importance to evaluate possible health risks for consumers. Most seaweeds are ingested after a heat treatment and these thermal procedures could lead to a change in arsenic speciation. In this work an arsenic speciation study of four edible seaweeds (Kombu, Wakame, Nori and Sea Lettuce) after cooking has been performed by anion-exchange HPLC connected to an ICP-MS for arsenical detection. Speciation studies were also carried out in the cooking waters of those samples. Powdered cooked seaweed was subjected to an in-vitro digestion procedure by using Piperazine-NN-bis (2-ethane-sulfonic acid) disodium (PIPES), as a buffer solution at a pH of 7.0 and dialysis membranes of 10kDa molecular weight cut off (MWCO). Dialyzable fractions were analyzed to identify the arsenic species that become bioavailable for human body functions. Total arsenic concentrations were found between 5.3 and 79.1μgg -1, 3.6-36.7μgg -1 and 1.8-54.3μgg -1 for raw and cooked seaweed, and cooking water, respectively. Total arsenic bioavailability percentages were 20%, 29%, 18% and 11% for cooked Kombu, Nori, Wakame and Sea lettuce, respectively. Results suggest that the heat treatment and the acidic environment and enzymes used in the in-vitro gastrointestinal digestion are not sufficient to produce a change in the arsenic species of the four seaweeds studied. Arsenic species are comparable in each seaweed before and after being cooked, their cooking water and dialysate. Arsenosugars were the main arsenic species found. As(III) species and arsenobetaine (AB) were only found in the Sea Lettuce sample. Glycerol sugar and sulfonate sugar were the most bioavailable species for cooked Kombu and Wakame.

Sampling was conducted bimonthly at Chincoteague Memorial Park, Virginia, and Indian River Inlet, Delaware, from 2005 to 2008. Proximate constituents of moisture, ash, dietary fiber, proteins, and fat were measured seasonally and calorific values were calculated. Data were analyzed using correlation, paired samples t-tests and one- and two-way ANOVA. Significant variations in the proximate constituents were found among seasons, species, and between sites. The brown seaweed (Fucus) at both sites had higher fiber, fat, and ash (mineral) content than the green (Ulva) or the red (Gracilaria). Ulva and Gracilaria had higher protein content than Fucus. Seaweeds from Delaware had more fat, ash, and protein than from Virginia, potentially because of the more polluted, nutrient rich environment at the Delaware site. Positive correlations between seaweed fat and protein content may indicate an increase in the synthesis of both components under optimal growth conditions.

Aim of study We investigated the effects of these carotenoids on the absorption of triglycerides in conscious rats implanted with cannulae into a lymph duct and the portal or jugular vein. Methods A duodenal infusion of 1 ml of test oil emulsion with or without 2 mg of fucoxanthin or fucoxanthinol was administered in the lymph duct and the portal (Experiment 1) or the jugular vein (Experiment 2) cannulated rats. The test oil contained 10% soybean oil (Experiment 1) and predigested 10% soybean oil (Experiment 2). The inhibitory activities of these carotenoids on pancreatic lipase activity were measured in vitro. Results Increases in lymphatic and blood triglyceride levels were much lower in the two carotenoid-treated groups than in the carotenoid-free group, indicating that these carotenoids inhibit triglyceride absorption. The total amounts of triglycerides released into the lymph after 4 h in the carotenoid-free, fucoxanthin and fucoxanthinol groups were 113.5, 59.4 and 53.1 lmol, respectively. The inhibitory effects of carotenoids were completely abolished after an infusion of pre-digested soybean oil containing carotenoids. Furthermore, these carotenoids inhibited pancreatic lipase activity in vitro. Regarding absorptive route, we found that fucoxanthinol, but not fucoxanthin, appeared in lymph fluid, whereas neither carotenoid was detected in portal blood.

Thirty-nine genes of the gametophyte and 62 genes of the sporophyte showed sequence similarity to those genes with known or putative functions which were classified according to their putative biological roles and molecular functions. The GO annotation showed about 58% of the cellular component of sporophyte and gametophyte cells were mainly located in cytoplasm and nucleus. The special genes were located in Golgi apparatus, and high expression in plastid, ribosome and endoplasmic reticulum. The main biological functions of gametophyte cells contributed to DNA repair/replication, carbohydrate metabolism, transport and transcription, especially in response to heat and oxidative stress. The sporophyte cell expresses more genes in transcription, transport, carbohydrate metabolism, particularly in signal transduction, DNA and protein modification, protein and nucleotide metabolism. Four genes are expressed on both gametophyte and sporophyte cells and eighteen genes have not been annotated.

However, Mg absorption is low in some seaweeds because fibers in these seaweeds suppress Mg absorption. We hypothesize that Mg absorption from some other seaweeds is not low because of the diversity of fibers. We measured Mg concentration and Mg solubility after in vitro digestion in edible seaweeds, Aosa (Ulvaceae pertusa), Kombu (Laminaria japonica) and Funori (Gloiopeltis furcata). Then we determined Mg absorption in rats given diets containing these seaweeds or magnesium oxide as the major source of Mg, and calculated Mg absorption from seaweeds. RESULTS: The fractional apparent absorption of Mg in seaweeds was Kombu = magnesium oxide > Aosa = Funori. Mg concentration was Aosa > Kombu and Funori had an intermediate amount of Mg, while Mg solubility after in vitro digestion was Funori = Kombu > Aosa. Consequently, the absorbable Mg concentration was Aosa = Kombu > Funori. CONCLUSION: The absorption of Mg from different seaweeds differs and is not affected by the Mg solubility alone.

Isolates of seaweeds (particularly viscous polysaccharides) are used in an increasing number of food applications in order to improve product acceptability and extend shelf-life.

The edible seaweed hijiki is a notable exception because it contains high levels of toxic arsenate and arsenite. Terrestrial plants detoxify arsenic by forming arsenitephytochelatin complexes. The hypothesis that seaweeds also synthesise phytochelatins to bind arsenite as a means of detoxification before arsenosugar synthesis is tested in this investigation. Abstract Phytochelatins (PCs), generic structure [-Glu-Cys]n-Gly, are peptides synthesised by terrestrial plants to bind toxic metal(loid)s such as cadmium and arsenic. Seaweeds are arsenic hyperaccumulators, seemingly achieving detoxification via arsenosugar biosynthesis. Whether seaweeds synthesise PCs to aid detoxification during arsenic exposure is unknown. Hizikia fusiforme (hijiki) and Fucus spiralis were used as model seaweeds: the former is known for its large inorganic arsenic concentration, whereas the latter contains mainly arsenosugars. F. spiralis was exposed to 0, 1 and 10mgL -1 arsenate solutions for 24h, whereas hijiki was analysed fresh. All samples contained As III, glutathione and reduced PC 2, identified using HPLC-ICP-MS/ES-MS. Although hijiki contained no As IIIPC complexes, arsenate exposed F. spiralis generated traces of numerous arsenic compounds that might be As IIIGS or As IIIPC 2 complexes. As IIIPC complexes seem not to be a principal storage form for long-term arsenic storage within seaweeds.

The coupling constrains the dynamical properties that the nervous system and the environment must have relative to each other if adaptive behavior is to be produced. In previous computational studies, such constraints have been used to evolve controllers or artificial agents to perform a behavioral task in a given environment. Often, however, we already know the controller, the real nervous system, and its dynamics. Here we propose that the constraints can also be used to solve the inverse problem - to predict from the dynamics of the nervous system the environment to which they are adapted, and so reconstruct the production of the adaptive behavior by the entire coupled system. We illustrate how this can be done in the feeding system of the sea slug Aplysia. At the core of this system is a central pattern generator (CPG) that, with dynamics on both fast and slow time scales, integrates incoming sensory stimuli to produce ingestive and egestive motor programs. We run models embodying these CPG dynamics - in effect, autonomous Aplysia agents - in various feeding environments and analyze the performance of the entire system in a realistic feeding task. We find that the dynamics of the system are tuned for optimal performance in a narrow range of environments that correspond well to those that Aplysia encounter in the wild. In these environments, the slow CPG dynamics implement efficient ingestion of edible seaweed strips with minimal sensory information about them. The fast dynamics then implement a switch to a different behavioral mode in which the system ignores the sensory information completely and follows an internal \"goal,\" emergent from the dynamics, to egest again a strip that proves to be inedible.

In the present study, the effect of MEGF on the growth of human hepatocarcinoma HepG2 cells and its effect on the cyclooxygenases (COXs) expression were investigated. MEGF markedly reduced the viability of HepG2 cells and induced the G2/M arrest of the cell cycle in a concentration dependent manner. These effects were associated with the down-regulation of cyclin A, up-regulation of cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) inhibitor p21 (WAF1/CIP1) and dephosphorylation of Cdc25C. Furthermore, it was found that MEGF decreased the levels of COX-2 mRNA and protein expression without significant changes in the levels of COX-1, which was correlated with a decrease in prostaglandin E 2 (PGE2) synthesis. These findings indicate that MEGF may have a possible therapeutic potential in hepatoma cancer patients.

The determination of iodide was directly performed in the alkaline digests, while total iodine was assessed by analyzing the hydroxylamine hydrochloride solution after the distillation process. Microwave-assisted alkaline digestion was performed using 7.5 mL of TMAH and irradiating samples at 670 W for two 5.5 min steps. Microwave-assisted distillation was carried out using 4.0 mL of the alkaline digest and 3 mL of a 2.2 M hydrochloric acid and 0.05% (m/v) sodium nitrite solution, with a microwave power at 670 W for two 90 s steps. The distillate (iodine vapor) was bubbled in 10 mL of a 500 μg mL-1 hydroxylamine hydrochloride solution (accepting solution). The linear calibration ranges were 0.30-20.0 and 0.40-20.0 μg L-1 for iodide determination and total iodine determination, respectively.

Oxidative stress was assessed based on the activities of antioxidant enzymes, level of reactive oxygen species, lipid peroxidation and reduced glutathione. Mitochondrial swelling was also analyzed. Ultra structural changes in renal tissue were analyzed with electron microscope. Hyperoxaluria induced a decrease in the activities of TCA cycle enzymes and respiratory complex enzymes. The oxidative stress was evident by the decrease in antioxidant enzymes, glutathione and an increase in reactive species and lipid peroxidation in mitochondria. Mitochondrial damage was evident by increased mitochondrial swelling.

Peroxide value (POV), ferrous chelating effect, remained ferrous ion and remained soluble copper were analyzed. Methanolic fraction of seaweed contained some polyphenolic compounds. That fraction did not affect POV under ferrous catalyst, however they reduced POV under copper catalyst. Catechin showed prooxidative activity by increasing POV and without making ferrous chelate.

As a result, different urinary excretion patterns were observed between inorganic and methylated arsenicals. Toxic inorganic As(V) and As(III) were detected in the urine 3 h after ingestion. The highest concentrations of As(V) and As(III) were observed at 6 and 15 h after ingestion, respectively. In contrast, methylated arsenic species in the urine, such as monomethylarsonic acid (MMA), dimethylarsinic acid (DMA), and arsenobetaine (AB), began to increase 10 h after ingestion and provided the highest concentrations at 21 h after ingestion. These results indicate that a large amount of As(V) from hijiki is excreted rapidly in urine and some part of it is reduced to As(III) in the human body. As(III) may then be converted to non-toxic methylated arsenic species and excreted in urine later than inorganic ones. It can be concluded from these experimental results that detoxification of arsenic occurs in the human body through the rapid urinary excretion of toxic arsenicals or by conversion to organic methylated ones after ingestion of hijiki. © 2005 The Chemical Society of Japan.\r",{"entities":[[234,251,"SEAWEED"],[256,264,"LOCATION"],[1535,1540,"LOCATION"]]}],["Edible seaweeds are considered a complementary source of food protein for human and animal nutrition.

In Asia, seaweeds have been used for centuries in salads, soups and as low-calorie dietetic foods. The dietary fibre which constitutes 25-75% of the dry weight of marine algae and represents their major component, is primarily soluble fibre. Nowadays, dietary fibre from different sources is known to decrease the risk of coronary heart disease, mainly due to its characteristics of dispersibility in water (water-holding capacity), viscosity, binding ability, absorPtive capacity, faecal bulking capacity and fermentability in the alimentary canal. Indigestible viscous seaweed polysaccharides such as alginates, carrageenans and funorans, which are capable of forming ionic colloids, have shown positive effects on serum lipid levels in rats. The capacity of seaweed polysaccharides to lower serum cholesterol levels seems to be due to their ability to disperse in water, retain cholesterol and related physiologically active compounds and inhibit lipid absorption in the gastrointestinal tract.

Chilean production comes mainly from wild stocks, as at present, cultivation on a commercial scale is restricted to Gra. chilensis. Total landings of Gracilaria currently stand at 120,000 wet tons. Large-scale cultivated biomass of this species, on the other hand, has been the result of a sharp increase in the number of farms, from less than 10 in 1982 to almost 322 in 1996. A basic understanding of key biological and ecophysiological aspects, as well as the availability of propagation methods, permitted the development of large-scale Gracilaria farming operations. However, during the cultivation process, new problems arose for the farmers, such as abrupt production decline, pests and pathogens. Similar key knowledge is lacking for other Chilean Rhodophyta, which creates a bottleneck that prevents the development of seaweed farming activities other than Gracilaria. This situation prevails in spite of the growing pressure on wild stocks triggered by an increase in the demand for raw material by the industry, with the obvious danger of over-exploitation and the resulting collapse of fisheries.

The liquid-like MAS and CPMAS 13C NMR spectra of the rehydrated algal powder revealed the presence of β-(1→4)/β-(1→3)-linked D-xylan with chemical shifts close to those observed in the solution 13C NMR spectrum of the polysaccharide. Observation of mix-linked xylan in the liquid-like MAS 13C NMR spectrum indicated that part of this cell wall polysaccharide is loosely held in the alga. The CPMAS NMR spectrum of the dry algal powder alcohol insoluble residue (AIR) showed broad peaks most of which corresponded to the mix-linked xylan. Hydration of AIR induced a marked increase in the signal resolution also in the CPMAS NMR spectra together with a shift of the C-3 and C-4 signals of the (1→3)- and (1→4)-linked xylose, respectively. Such modifications were present in the spectrum of hydrated (1→3)-linked xylan from the green seaweed Caulerpa taxifolia and absent in that of (1→4)-linked xylan from P. palmata. This result emphasizes the important role of (1→3) linkages on the mix-linked xylan hydration-induced conformational rearrangement. The mix-linked xylan signals were observed in the CPMAS NMR spectrum of hydrated residues obtained after extensive extractions by NaOH or strong chaotropic solutions indicating strong hydrogen bonds or covalent linkages. T1ρ relaxations were measured close or above 10 ms for the mix-linked xylan in the dry and hydrated state in AIR and indicated that the overall xylan chains likely remain rigid. Rehydration of the mix-linked xylan lead to a decrease in the motion of protons bounded to the C-1 and C-4 carbons of the (1→4)-linked xylose supporting the re-organization of the xylan chains under hydration involving junction-zones held by hydrogen bonds between adjacent (1→4)-linked xylose blocks.

A review concerning nutritional and physiological properties of edible seaweeds is presented. Seaweeds are traditionally consumed in Asia as sea vegetables, but in Western countries they have been used as sources of gelling or thickening agents. From a nutritional point of view, they are low-calorie foods, with a high concentration of minerals (Mg, Ca, P, K and I), vitamins, proteins and undigestible carbohydrates, and a low content in lipids. Quality of protein and lipid in seaweeds is aceptable comparing with other diet vegetables mainly due to their high content in essential aminoacids and their relative high levels of unsatured fatty acids. Dietary fiber content range from 33% to 75% of dry weight, and mainly consist of soluble polysaccharides (range from 17% to 59%). Seaweeds constitute a source of dietary fiber that differ chemically and physicochemically from those of land plants and thus may induce different physiological effects. Referenced data indicate that algal dietary fiber may show important functional activities, such as antioxidant, antimutagenic and anticoagulant effect, antitumor activity, and an important role in the modification of lipid metabolism in human body. In conclusion, seaweeds have a high nutritional value, therefore an increase in their consumption, would elevate the foods offer to population.\r",{"entities":[]}],["Caulerpa lentillifera is a kind of edible seaweed, known as 'sea grape' or 'green caviar'.

In this study we investigated of marine bacteria and V. parahaemolyticus in C. lentillifera and cultured them in order to develop effective control of bacteria in commercial farms. The sixteen farms in the Okinawa Islands were investigated from August to September in 2006.

About 103 cfu/mL of marine bacteria were detected in the seawater used in the tank culture, but after cultivation of C. lentillifera the number had increased to about 106 cfu/mL. The number of marine bacteria in C. lentillifera did not change significantly through the process of planting to the final product (about 107 cfu/g).

Vertical rope rafts were installed in two locations. Fronds were attached to 4-mm polyethylene ropes that were suspended from a steel frame secured in position using weights and buoys. In the first two trials (April to August 1999) we investigated the effects of the outplanting season (spring-summer), and length of the cultivation period (number of weeks) on the growth of P. palmata. Cultivation in autumn and winter was not performed due to the rough sea conditions. The following three trials (April to August 2000) aimed to test the effects on the growth and quality (i.e. N content) of the fronds of other additional factors: cultivation technique (fronds inside mesh bags versus directly inserted into ropes), use of marginal proliferations as source stock (versus field material), different stocking densities, and addition of nutrients versus no enrichment. Maximum observed growth during the best cultivation season in spring was about 14% of the initial fresh weight per day (about 0.7 g FW). The growth of cultivated fronds was noticeably greater than the growth of field individuals and four weeks was a suitable period for cultivation. The bag method was better than inserting the fronds into ropes due to the avoidance of frond loss, and enhancement of the quality. Appropriate stocking density was very important when using bags since the growth tended to decrease with increasing number of fronds per bag. The artificial nutrient enrichment also enhanced the quality of the fronds in two locations, and the growth in one site (with lower seawater nutrient concentration). Nutrient enhanced fronds grew at a rate similar to that observed one month and a half earlier when nutrient concentration was higher. In Spain the stock of P. palmata is limited. However, the marginal proliferations grew at a similar rate than field material partially solving this limitation.

Sensory evaluation was practiced by five professional technicians. They recoreded the rank of softness employing a line scale method. For the dried samples, the order of elongation and rupture strength agreed essentially with the rank of softness by sensory evaluation. However, the degree of the strength was different from the results of the sensory evaluation. For the wetted samples, the order of the rupture strength did not agree with that for the dried ones, but with the order of the time required to peel into nori pieces in water. The result of the sensory evaluation showed a tendency to separate into only two textural categories, i.e. soft and firm. A similar tendency was observed for the peeling time. These results suggested that there are two sensory systems in our mouth; one was a system perceived nori as soft on the basis of the force to slide each piece of nori, and another was a system that perceived nori as firm on the basis of the force to bite it off. © 1991, The Japanese Society of Fisheries Science.

The frond of this alga was cultured for a period of 2 days with one of these compounds as the sole nitrogen source. The comparison was made on the basis of both the decreasing rate of the added nitrogen in the culture media and the forms and amounts of the nitrogenous constituents of the frond. The results obtained are shown in Tables 1~4, and are summarized as follows: ( 1 ) Ammonia was easily absorbed by the frond, in which the soluble nitrogenous compounds, chiefly amide, alanine, glutamic acid and citrulline, were accumulated. The insoluble nitrogen in the frond, however, did not increase so markedly as the soluble nitrogen. ( 2 ) Nitrate was also absorbed easily, and usually a large amount of nitrate was accumulated in the frond. This suggests that further reduction and conversion of nitrate to organic forms might be restricted by the capacity of the alga to reduce it. However, since the use of nitrate as the nitrogen source characteristically leads to a relatively low content of soluble nitrogen, it seems that this nitrogen source is generally more conducive to the protein synthesis than ammonia or nitrite. ( 3 ) The permeability of the frond to nitrite was not so great. Once nitrite was absorbed, however, it was reduced entirely and caused a marked increase of soluble nitrogenous compounds in the frond, as in the case of ammonia.

The samples selected in this study were: Wakame (Undaria pinnatifida), Makonbu (Laminaria japonica), Nagakonbu (Laminaria angustata), Rishirikonbu (Laminaria japonica var. ochotensis), Hijiki (Hijikia fusiforme), Tengusa (Gelidium amansii) and Asakusanori (Porphyra tenera). DF were analyzed by modifying the method of Southgate. Crude fiber contents were determined by the usual method. The results were compared with those of neutral detergent fiber(NDF) by the method of Van Soest and with CF content on the same samples. The DF content of Japanese seaweeds was about l2~44%. These values were 1. 2~3. 9 times as high as NDF content, except for Asakusanori, and 2. 2~6.1 times as high as CF. Seaweeds contain alginic acid, laminaran, fucoidan, agar and other polysaccharides which belong to undigestible polysaccharides. Therefore, the NDF method of Van Soest was not adequate for DF determination of seaweeds, because some parts of the undigestible carbohydrates in seaweed as DF may be dissolved in NDF reagents. In addition, some modifications of Southgate method may be necessary for analyzing seaweed DF.

The sampled positions on the blade are shown in Fig. 1. The results of survey are given in Tables 1 and 2, and in Figs. 2 and 3. As known in the above tables and figures, the parts of the blade near to the base and stipe are richer in nitrogen and are larger in thickness than the marginal and apical parts. As was reported in the previous paper1' by Oishi et al, the base and stipe of a blade are better in quality than the margins and apex. Consequently it may be concluded that the quality of the parts on a blade depends closely upon its thickness and nitrogen content. The average values of thickness and nitrogen content in the various parts, – stipe, base, center, margins, and apex are exhibited in Table 3. These values will also indicate the degree of quality of kombu parts.

To analyse this problem, the authors studied the antimutagenic and antitumor promotion activities in methanol-soluble extracts of typical edible seaweeds which showed suppressive effects on 3-amino-1,4-dimethyl-5H-pyrido[4,3-b]indol (Trp-P-1)-induced umu C gene expression in SOS response of Salmonella typhimurium (TA 1535/pSK 1002) and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)-dependent ornithine decarboxylase induction in BALB/c 3T3 fibroblast cells. Although eight varieties of edible seaweeds including chlorophyta, Phaenophyta and Rhodophyta showed significant antimutagenic and antipromotion activities, they expressed the activities different from each other. Among these seaweeds, Enteromorpha prolifera ('Sujiaonori' in Japanese) and Porphyra tenera ('Asakusanori') showed relatively strong suppressive activities in both antimutagenic and antipromotion assays compared with other seaweeds. These seaweeds contained considerable amounts of β-carotene as a possible active principle with anticarcinogenic activity. This compound was partially associated with the antimutagenic activity in the seaweed extract, but did not contribute to the antipromotion activity of seaweed extract under our experimental conditions. These results strongly suggest that Japanese edible seaweeds have possible antimutagenic and antipromotion activities probably associated with antitumor activity. © 1994.\r",{"entities":[[82,87,"LOCATION"],[846,868,"SEAWEED"],[900,915,"SEAWEED"],[1418,1426,"LOCATION"]]}],["Extracts from seaweed are of botanical and pharmaceutical interest.
